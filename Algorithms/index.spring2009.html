<h3>What this course is about</h3>
</a>
This course focuses on the time and memory requirements of the
algorithms (procedures) that are embodied in computer programs.
We will discuss both <i>analysis</i> of existing algorithms
as well as <i>design</i> of new algorithms with a view toward
achieving efficient computational procedures.
Course topics include divide and conquer design, fundamental data 
structures, asymptotic notation, analysis of recurrence relations,
greedy algorithms, search, and dynamic programming. 

<ul>

</ul>

<p>

<a name="prereq">
<h3>Prerequisites / Recommended background</h3>
</a>
The prerequisites for CS383 are programming
and data structures at the level of CS101 and CS102 (including a good grasp
of recursion), and discrete mathematics at the level of CS 245 (including
familiarity with basic proof techniques and mathematical induction). 
Additional background in mathematics and computer science would help 
but is not required.
If you have any questions about prerequisites, please contact me.

<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</a>

<h4>Start early, work hard</h4>

<a href="environment.html">Download and install the software</a> 
for this course before the end of the first week of classes.
You'll need it for HW1, due Tuesday, Jan. 22.
Then read the <a href="intro.html">introduction</a> linked from
the CS383 homepage.
Throughout the semester, attend class, keep up with the reading
assignments posted on the CS383 homepage, study the sample programs
provided on the homepage, and get started on homework assignments 
as soon as possible. 
Accept that some concepts
may not come easily. You may need to go over your notes and 
the relevant sections of the book several times in connection 
with a specific concept or homework problem. In so doing you 
may realize that you need to go back to previous sections 
that you thought you already understood. This process of
going back and forth ("it's a spiral, not a circle"),
gradually increasing your level of understanding, may take 
several hours, or even days, depending on the complexity of 
the problem.

<h4>Take one step at a time</h4>

Once you feel comfortable with the basic background concepts 
for a programming problem, start the design phase. Try to
break the task down into manageable parts that can be dealt 
with somewhat independently of one another. Design your program 
so that it reflects this way of partitioning the task (I'll 
discuss this approach in class). Sketch out an outline of the 
program structure, together with a specification of what each 
chunk is supposed to do. Then start the implementation (code 
writing) phase. Program one chunk at a time; test each program 
chunk and revise it as needed until the chunk behaves correctly
(according to its specification from the design phase) before 
moving on to the next chunk.

<h4>Explain your thinking</h4>

Once you feel comfortable with the basic background concepts 
When preparing homework solutions, you should strive for 
maximum clarity and simplicity. Programs should be as
uncluttered as possible. Detailed comments should be
included throughout each program.
Any write-ups should reveal the key ingredients and the 
structure of your reasoning. Include detailed explanations. 
These comments apply equally well to exam solutions.

<p><hr><p>

<a name="grading">
<h3>Grading</h3>
</a>

The course grade will be based on homework and exams.

<ul>

<p><li> <h4>Homework (25%)</h4>
Homework will be due in most weeks during the semester. 
HW should be submitted 
in hardcopy by the beginning of class on the due date. Source code for 
any programs should be included in the hardcopy submission, and should
also be e-mailed to me and the TA before the submission deadline.
<i>Late homework submissions will receive no credit</i> except in unusual 
circumstances, at the discretion of the instructor. 
<i>In order to be eligible to pass the course, you must complete and submit 
at least 2 out of every 3 homework assignments.</i>

<!--
<p><li> <h4>Term project (25%)</h4>
Each student will complete a term project that illustrates
and possibly extends some of the ideas presented in the course.
-->

<p><li> <h4>Midterm Exams and Quizzes (45%)</h4>
Three in-class midterm exams will be given.
See the schedule below for exam dates. Note that one of the exams will be
held immediately prior to Spring Vacation. <i>No make-up exams will 
be given, so plan ahead.</i> One or more quizzes may also be held,
and would contribute to this part of your grade also.

<p><li> <h4>Final Exam (30%)</h4>
A cumulative final exam will be held on Wed. May 6th at 12:30 pm.

</ul>

<!--
<h3>Late homework policy ("One and a half strikes for free")</h3> 
Your lowest homework grade 
will be dropped. In particular, if <i>for whatever reason</i> you are 
not able to submit an assignment on time (or at all), you may use your 
free strike to keep the 0 grade on the late (or missed) assignment from 
affecting your final course grade. Note carefully that exams are not 
covered by this policy. 
<p> The half strike allows you to submit one HW assignment one day late
without penalty. Again, no questions are asked.

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li> <i>Any late or missed assignments beyond those covered by the
above policy will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment(s) in
question, thus negatively affecting your course grade. Please plan 
carefully.</i>
<p><li> <i>Any student who misses four or more homework assignments 
will be ineligible to receive a passing grade in the course.</i>
</ul>
-->

<a name="honesty">
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
</a>
<i>You must individually design and write your own solutions for 
all assignments.</i> Furthermore, you should explicitly acknowledge 
any sources of ideas that are not your own; this includes other 
people, books, web pages, etc. Behavior that is not in the spirit 
of these guidelines is considered to be academically dishonest.
Please also see the university's statement on academic integrity below.
If you're unsure about what 
constitutes academic dishonesty in a particular situation, 
ask me before proceeding further.

<h4>University statement on academic integrity</h4>

Boston College values the academic integrity of its students and faculty. 
It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the university's 
policy on academic integrity: 

<a href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/stserv/academic/resources/policy/#integrity">
http://www.bc.edu/offices/stserv/academic/resources/policy/#integrity</a>
<p>
If you have any questions, always consult your professor.
Violations of academic integrity will be reported to your class dean and 
judged by the academic integrity committee in your school. If you are found 
responsible for violating the policy, penalties may include a failing grade 
as well as possible probation, suspension, or expulsion, depending on the 
seriousness and circumstances of the violation.
<!--
and may be reported to the appropriate class dean for review 
by the Academic Integrity Board.
