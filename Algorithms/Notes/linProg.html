<h3>Continuous Optimization</h3>

	We've discussed optimization algorithms for discrete problems

		Making change minimize number of coins)

		Sequence similarity (minimize edit distance)

		Knapsack problem (maximize total value)

	In such problems, the objects involved, and the objective function,
	are intrinsically discrete

	However, many optimization problems are more naturally
	viewed as continuous

	We'll study one class of such continuous optimization problems

		
<h3>Linear Programming (LP)</h3>

	In LP, the goal is to optimize a linear objective function
	subject to linear constraints

	Example (exercise 7.3 in the book)

		cargo plane has maximum capacity

			100 tons, 60 m^3

		can load with 3 materials, with following conditions:

			m1: density 2 tons/m^3, 40 m^3 available
				revenue: $1000/m^3

			m2: density 1 ton/m^3, 30 m^3 available
				revenue: $1200/m^3

			m3: density 3 tons/m^3, 20 m^3 available
				revenue: $12000/m^3

		how to load so as to maximize revenue?

	LP formulation:

		Let xi be the volume of material i to be loaded

		Revenue:

			R(x1,x2,x3) = 1000*x1 + 1200*x2 + 12000*x3

		Revenue is to be maximized subject to constraints below

		Cargo volume constraint:

			x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;= 60

		Cargo weight constraint:

			2*x1 + 1*x2 + 3*x3 &lt;= 100

		Material availability constraints:

			0 &lt;= x1 &lt;= 40
			0 &lt;= x2 &lt;= 30
			0 &lt;= x3 &lt;= 20


<h3>General form of LP problem</h3>

	Given real variables x1...xn, and coefficients c1...cn,
	b1...bm, and coefficients aij, i=1...m, j=1...n, 

	optimize the linear objective function

		sum_{j=1...n} cj*xj

	subject to the m linear constraints

		sum_{j=1...n} aij*xj &lt;= bi,  i=1...m


<h3>Matrix notation</h3>

	A more compact notation is helpful and is
	suitable for Matlab solution of LP problems

	Write the variables xj as a column vector:

		x = (x1...xn)'

	(the prime represents transposition, which changes
	rows into columns and vice-versa)

	Write the objective function coefficients cj and 
	constraint RHS coefficients bi as column vectors:

		c = (c1...cn)',  b = (b1...bm)'

	and the constraint LHS coefficients aij as an mxn matrix
	(m rows, n columns) with the coeffients corresponding to 
	bi in the i-th row

		A = (aij) (row i, col j)

	Then the LP problem is written compactly as follows:
	
	optimize c'x subject to the constraint Ax &lt;= b


<h3>Matrix notation example: for the cargo plane problem above:</h3>

	c = (1000, 1200, 12000)'

	b = (60, 100, 0, 40, 0, 30, 0, 20)'

	A =

		1	1	1
		2	1	3
		-1	0	0
		1	0	0
		0	-1	0	
		0	1	0	
		0	0	-1	
		0	0	1	


<h3>Solving LP problems</h3>

	LP problems may be interpreted geometrically

	The feasible region is a polytope, a convex region 
	delimited by hyperplanes in n-space

	The objective function may be understood in terms of
	its level surfaces, which are also hyperplanes

	The goal is to find the objective function hyperplane 
	that has the largest possible level value

	Geometrically, this corresponds to moving the hyperplane
	in the direction of increasing objective value while it remains 
	perpendicular to a fixed vector (the vector that defines the 
	objective function), until the last point at which the objective 
	hyperplane intersects the feasible region

	This occurs at one of the vertices of the feasible polytope

	The simplex algorithm solves LP problems based on the above
	description, greedily searching on the vertices of the feasible 
	region, evaluating the objective function at each vertex, 
	and stopping when no increase is observed


<h3>2-D LP Example</h3>

	Consider the cargo problem with only the first two materials

		max 1000*x1 + 1200*x2 subject to

		x1 + x2 &lt;= 60
		2x1 + x2 &lt;= 100
		0 &lt;= x1 &lt;= 40
		0 &lt;= x2 &lt;= 30

	Draw the feasible region and its vertices

	Solve LP problem by traversing vertices, seeking max f


<h3>3-D LP Example: the cargo plane problem formulated above</h3>

	Higher-D LP problems can be solved by hand, but harder to visualize

	Do cargo example from my handwritten/sketched notes

	Conclusion is that feasible region has vertices at

		(20, 0, 20)
		(40, 0, 20/3)
		(40, 20, 0)
		(30, 30, 0)
		(20, 30, 10)
		(5, 30, 20)
	
	plus the obvious "rear" vertices (see figure in notes) at

		(0, 0, 0)
		(0, 0, 20)
		(0, 30, 20)
		(0, 30, 0)
		(40, 0, 0)


<h3>LP solution in Matlab</h3>

	Matlab provides the function linprog

		linprog(f, A, b)

	which returns the solution of the LP problem

		min f'x subject to Ax &lt;= b

	Notice that this problem is in "standard form":

		min instead of max

		only "less than" inequality constraints

	It's easy to cast any LP problem in this standard form


<h3>Example of LP solution in Matlab: the cargo problem</h3>

	I illustrated how to cast as standard LP problem

	Then solved in Matlab...


<h3>Summary so far: Linear Programming (LP)</h3>

	Goal is to optimize a linear objective function
	subject to linear constraints

	Write the variables xj as a column vector:

		x = (x1...xn)'

	and the objective function coefficients cj and 
	constraint RHS coefficients bi as column vectors:

		c = (c1...cn)',  b = (b1...bm)'

	and the constraint LHS coefficients aij as an mxn matrix
	(m rows, n columns) with i-th constraint in i-th row

		A = (aij) (row i, col j)

	Then the LP problem is written compactly as follows:
	
		optimize c'x subject to the constraint Ax &lt;= b

	LP problems may be interpreted geometrically

	The feasible region is a polytope, a convex region 
	delimited by hyperplanes in n-space

	The simplex algorithm solves LP problems by a greedy hillclimb
	on the vertices of the feasible region


<h3>LP solution in Matlab</h3>

	Matlab provides the function linprog

		linprog(f, A, b)

	which returns the solution of the LP problem

		min f'x subject to Ax &lt;= b

	Notice that this problem is in "standard form":

		min instead of max

		only "less than" inequality constraints

	It's easy to cast any LP problem in this standard form

		change sign of objective function if need to maximize

		split each equality constraint into two inequalities


<h3>Network flow</h3>

	Graph edge weights can model the capacities of various links
	to transport a quantity that satisfies "conservation of mass"
	(e.g., actual mass, or electrical current, or network traffic)

	One may wish to maximize total flow from one node to another

	This is the maximum flow problem:

	Input: directed graph G with positive edge weights c(e) ("capacities"), 
	source node s of G, sink node t of G

	Output: assignment of a non-negative "flow" f(e) to each edge e of G
	such that:

	1) (conservation of mass) for each vertex v of G except s and t,

		total flow into v = total flow out of v
	
	2) (capacity constraint) for each edge e of G,

		f(e) &lt;= c(e)

	3) (maximality) the total flow leaving s ("size" of the flow) is 
	as large as possible among flows satisfying constraints 1) and 2).
	

<h3>Maximum flow is a familiar type of problem</h3>

	Max flow therefore consists of solving the following problem,
	where the variables are the quantities f(e) over all edges e in G:

		max sum_{e leaving s} f(e)

	subject to the constraints

		sum_{e entering v} f(e) = sum_{e leaving v} f(e), 
			(for every vertex v except s and t)

		0 &lt;= f(e) &lt;= c(e)
			(for every edge e)

	Notice that the quantity to be maximized and the constraints
	are linear in the variables f(e) - this is just LP!


<h3>An algorithm for maximum flow</h3>

	Simplex may be applied to maximum flow and has an interesting interpretation:

	Starting from 0 flow, it iteratively finds a path from source to sink and 
	increases the flow along all edges of that path by the minimum edge capacity

	In order to allow tentative flow assignments to decrease during 
	a run of the algorithm, the notion of residual network is used

	A backward edge is added for each edge that has a nonzero flow
	assigned to it; the capacity of the backward edge is exactly
	the flow amount on the forward edge

	The residual network of G for a given flow f is denoted G^f


<h3>Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm</h3>

    	Inputs: directed graph G with capacities c, source node s, sink node t
    	Output: maximum flow f from s to t

       	1. f(u,v) = 0 for all edges (u,v)
       	2. While there is a path p: s -&gt; t in G^f with residual capacities &gt; 0
             a. Find c^f(p) = min {c^f(u,v) | (u,v) in the path p}
             b. For each edge (u,v) in p
                   i. f(u,v) = f(u,v) + c^f(p) (saturate flow along the path)
		   ii. c^f(v,u) = c^f(v,u) - c^f(p) (update residual capacity)

	3. return f


<h3>Ford-Fulkerson example</h3>

	We did an example in class using a network with 5 edges


<h3>Max flow - min cut theorem</h3>

	Ford-Fulkerson terminates when every path in the residual network 
	contains an edge of capacity 0

	Define the set of nodes reachable from the source node as those
	that are reachable via a path with positive residual capacities

	Notice that the cut between the reachable nodes and the non-reachable 
	nodes consists of edges of residual capacity 0; in other words, 
	all such edges are at full capacity in the original network

	This fact proves the following:

	The maximum flow in a network is the same as the capacity of 
	the minimum cut that separates the source and target nodes


<h3>Maximum network flow via LP in Matlab</h3>

	One can also directly apply simplex to max flow problems

	We illustrated by casting a previous example directly as LP

	Remember that Matlab expects LP problem to be in "standard form"

		minimize objective function

		only inequality constraints

	Address these requirements as follows:

		change sign of objective function to target max instead of min

		split each equality constraint into two inequalities

	Do in Matlab

		Original network had 5 edges

		Use one flow variable per edge: 5 variables

		5 edges lead to 5 sign constraints, 5 capacity constraints

		flow conservation yields 2 equality constraints per node
		(but not for source and sink nodes)

			split into 4 inequality constraints

		total of 14 variables

		constraint matrix is 14x5
