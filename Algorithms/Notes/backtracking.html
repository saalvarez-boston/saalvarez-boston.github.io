<h1>CSCI 3383, Algorithms
<br>Depth-first search with backtracking
</h1>
</center>

<p><hr><p>

<pre>
I describe an example of applying depth-first search to the implicit graph
associated with the nonattacking chess queens problem.

<h3>Graphs</h3>

        Recall that a graph is just a set of "nodes" or "vertices", 
	together with "edges" (connections) between some pairs of nodes

        If the connections have a direction, the graph is said to be "directed"


<h3>Graph traversals</h3>

   Many problems involve searching a graph, at least implicitly

   Examples:

      most optimization problems require searching for a solution
         e.g. the knapsack problem (later)

      "puzzles" such as the n-queens problem also require search

                the problem is to place n queens on an nxn chess board
                so that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal

                each node in the n-queens graph represents a board configuration
                with some or all of the queens present

                the search objective is to find a configuration in which all
                queens have been placed and no two are attacking one another

   Searching a graph is related to the task of exploring all of a graph's nodes

        The latter task is called graph traversal


<h3>Depth-first graph traversal algorithm</h3>

   depth_first(v) {
      S = empty stack
      mark(v)
      push v onto S
      while (S not empty) {
         while (some w adjacent to top(S) is unmarked) {
            mark(w)
            push w onto S
         }
         pop(S)
      }
   }


<h3>Example</h3>

   1 ---&gt; 2 &lt;--- 3 
   |      |     /
   |      |    /
   v      v   /
   5      4 &lt; 


   Depth-first traversal visits 1, 2, 4, 5 upon calling depth_first(1)
   To get node 3, a separate main procedure would be needed


<h3>Searching implicit graphs</h3>

   Need arises in game playing, puzzles

   Nodes of graph represent partially constructed solutions

   Example: n-queens problem

   Given: nxn chess board, n chess queens

   Objective: place the n queens on the board so that
      no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal

   Root node represents initial empty board configuration

   Each node adjacent to the root might represent a tentative position for the first queen


<h3>Backtracking</h3>

   Technique for searching for solutions in an implicit graph

   Variant of depth-first traversal in which nodes are only expanded if they 
   are "promising" in the sense of being feasible precursors to a solution

   Depends on notion of "k-promising vector"
   v[1..k] is k-promising if a heuristic indicates that v can be
      extended to a complete solution v[1..n]

   Example: n-queens problem
   v[1..k] represents tentative board positions for queens 1..k
   v[1..k] is k-promising if no two queens among 1..k are attacking each other


<h3>Abbreviated backtracking pseudocode</h3>

   backtrack(v[1..k]) {
      if v is a solution 
	report v
      else 
         for each promising choice of x
            backtrack(v[1..k];v[k+1]&lt;-x)
   }


<h3>Application to n-queens problem</h3>

   Place i-th queen in i-th row; only need to decide which column to use

   Start with queen 1 in row 1
   Place in column 1
   Record tentative move by pushing data onto history stack

   Move to next queen
   Try next column
   While there's conflict with any previously placed queens, move right
   If edge of board is reached, backtrack:
      pop stack, attempt to reposition that queen...

<h4>More detailed pseudocode for depth-first search with backtracking for the n-queens problem</h4>

   s = empty stack of "moves" (each consisting of a queen and a board position)
   move = (queen 1, position = (row 1, column 0))
   current_queen = 1

   do {
   // search for a position for the current queen
   // the k-th queen goes in the k-th row
      	position.row = current_queen
      	if (position.col &gt; n) // if previous position failed, move queen one column to the right
         	position.col = move.pos.col + 1
      	else			// start by placing current queen in column 1
         	position.col = 1
      	while ((there is a conflict between position and previous moves recorded in s) and (position.col &lt;= n)) 
         	position.col++	// seek the first non-conflicting position
      	if (position.col &gt; n) {	// no admissible position found
         	current_queen-- 	// backtrack to previous queen
         	if (s is not empty) {
            		move = s.top()	// pop previous queen's tentative move
            		s.pop()
         	}
         else // if stack is empty here, we're out of luck - there's no solution
            	report that no solutions exist
      	}
      	else { // no conflict, so record move
         	move.queen = current_queen
         	move.pos = position
         	s.push(move)
         	current_queen++		// on to next queen
      	}
   } while (current_queen &lt;= n)
   report solution


<h3>Depth-first search results for n-queens problem</h3>

I wrote a program based on the above pseudocode. Below is a sample run showing how 
depth-first search with backtracking solves the 4-queens problem.

Notice that once the first two queens have been tentatively placed at (row,col) 
positions (1,1) and (2,3), there is no admissible position for a queen in row 3. 
This leads to the first occurrence of backtracking, which results in the second 
queen being repositioned from column 3 to column 4.
However, this change eventually leads to a problem in row 4. Backtracking ensues, triggering a chain 
of changes that finally results in the repositioning of the first queen from column 1 to column 2. 
This finally allows a solution.

<h3>Depth-first/backtracking vs. random permutations for n-queens</h3>

For comparison purposes, I pitted depth-first with backtracking against a
completely different strategy for solving the n-queens problem, namely
random search. The latter strategy may be outlined as follows:

while (true) {
	randomly generate board locations for the n queens
	if the randomly chosen locations solve the n-queens problem
		report success
}

This isn't sufficiently detailed pseudocode, as it leaves out details that
impact the running time significantly. In particular, how are the random
board locations generated? Here are some options:

	1) Locations of the different queens are generated independently;
	for each queen, pick row and column values randomly among the values 1...n

	2) Only one queen is placed in each row (as in the backtracking approach), 
	but the column locations are chosen independently for different queens.
	This option has the advantage of preventing row conflicts by design.

	3) Only one queen is placed in each row, and pairwise distinct random
	column locations are chosen for different queens. This option has the 
	advantage of preventing both row and column conflicts.

In practice, option 1) leads to a program with a ridiculously long running time.
Options 2 and 3 are better. 

For the 4-queens problem, for example, 20 runs lead to the following statistics 
for the number of "basic steps" performed by each algorithm:

			mean 	standard deviation

random option 2		152		113
random option 3		10		12
backtracking		12		0

Even though the notion of "basic step" used in this table differs across algorithms 
in a way that favors the random search algorithms (a basic step for the random search algorithms 
is a choice of locations for all of the queens, while a step for the depth-first algorithm
with backtracking involves placing only one queen), these results do show that random option 3
is much faster than random option 2 as expected, and they suggest that random option 3
might even hold its own against depth-first search with backtracking (although it is
also clear that both random search options exhibit a large variability in the run times).

In order to shed light on the latter issue, I ran random search option 3 against
depth-first search with backtracking for larger values of the number of queens, n. 
Time was used as the metric rather than steps, given the differing notion of step
for these two algorithms as mentioned above. The results, shown below, should be
interpreted with caution as they reflect only a single run of each algorithm for
each value of n. Better temporal resolution would require performing multiple runs
of each algorithm for each n, and computing summary statistics. 

For full disclosure: the times below were obtained on a really old machine 
(year 2010 or so). The absolute times will be different on new hardware, but
relative performance of the two algorithms, and overall qualitative conclusions,
will be similar to what is shown here.

	Running times in seconds for the n-queens problem
	Programs were timed out after 5 minutes

	n	depth-first search	random search option 3

	10		0			0.02
	11		0.01			0.1
	12		0			0.01
	13		0.01			0.78
	14		0.09			0.23
	15		0.06			1.8
	16		0.55			18.3
	17		0.32			0.5
	18		2.5			56.06
	19		0.18			157.33
	20		15.56			out of time
	21		0.71
	22		159.01
	23		2.46
	24		out of time

The above results suggest that depth-first search with backtracking is significantly faster
than random search for the n-queens problem for "larger" values of n. Notice that
the running time for backtracking is less than that of random search for all values of n &gt;= 12.
Also, the available program run time of 5 minutes was exhausted by random search for n = 20,
while backtracking also managed to finish under the time limit for n=20,21,22,23.
Adding 4 to the maximum manageable problem size may not seem impressive. This highlights
a fact about exponential running times that is difficult to swallow: multiplying the speed by a
constant factor (even a large one) merely adds a constant to the maximum manageable problem size.
