<pre>
	A class is a type that describes composite objects with a common "language" of allowable "behaviors".

	Like the Nodes of a linked list, but such that each Node not only stores data but can also perform certain computations.

	The instances of a class are called objects

	Object-oriented programming involves defining classes and performing computations by creating and using objects of those classes

	The member functions of a class allow one to access and manipulate the data stored inside individual objects


<h3>Interface vs. implementation</h3>

	Behavior of objects of a class is described in class' *public interface*

	The public interface is like a contract between the class and the outside world - it states what can be expected of the class and what is expected of users of the class

		like going to a bank - you can expect to be able to create a savings account, and to be able to deposit funds into, and withdraw funds from your account

		you, as a customer, are expected to fill out the appropriate forms when requesting transactions, and you must adhere to rules such as not withdrawing more than the balance in your account

	The contract does *not* state internal details regarding *how* the class will keep its end of the contract

		those details are in the *implementation* of the class

		only the programmers of the class need to deal with the implementation aspects of the class


<h3>Example of a class: OneDWalker</h3>

	OneDWalker instances represent point objects that move along a line

	The public interface of the OneDWalker class is as follows:

	Public data members:
	// walkers start at this location
		static const int DEFAULT_LOCATION = 50;	
	// avg. number of columns per move
		static const int AVERAGE_SPEED = 5;	

	Constructor:
	// creates a new OneDwalker instance
		OneDWalker();		

	Public member functions:

	Selector (accessor) functions:
	// returns current location of recipient (in columns)
		double getLocation();
	// prints current location of recipient (as a number of columns)
		void printLocation();
	// prints the argument string at the recipient's current location
		void drawLocation(string label);

	Modifier (mutator) functions:
	// changes recipient's location by a random amount based on speed
		void step();
	// changes recipient's speed randomly
                void changeSpeed();


<h3>Sample program that uses the OneDWalker class</h3>

	Even though we haven't written the OneDWalker class yet, we can already write a program that uses the class

		don't forget to include the header file for the class

	All we need to know is the public interface of the OneDWalker class, which is described above

	Eg, a program that creates a OneDWalker instance and moves it 10 times:

		#include "OneDWalker.h"

		int main() {
        		OneDWalker stroller = OneDWalker();
        		for (int step=0; step&lt;10; step++) {
                		stroller.step();
                		stroller.drawLocation("*");
			}
        		return EXIT_SUCCESS;
		}


<h3>Another sample client program of the OneDWalker class</h3>

	Move a walker until it reaches the middle of the screen

	bool hitMiddle(OneDWalker w) {
        	return w.getLocation() &lt; 10;
	}
	
	int main() {
        	cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "This program moves a random walker until it" &lt;&lt; endl;
        	cout &lt;&lt; "reaches the left 10 columns of the screen." &lt;&lt; endl;
        	OneDWalker middler = OneDWalker();
        	int steps = 0;
        	while (!hitMiddle(middler)) {
                	middler.step();
                	middler.drawLocation("*");
                	steps++;
        	}
        	cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Done! That took " &lt;&lt; steps &lt;&lt; " steps" &lt;&lt; endl;
        	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
	}

<h3>Defining a class</h3>

	Defining a class involves defining the private data members that 
	provide data storage inside each instance, and defining the public 
	member functions that allow the internal data to be accessed by 
	other programs

	Note that other (client) programs cannot access the private data 
	members directly; instead, they *must* go through the public functions

	class outline in C++ is as follows:

	class ClassName {
		public:
			public functions and other public data members go here
		private:
			data members hidden inside individual objects go here
	};


<h3>Implementation of the OneDWalker class: private data members</h3>

	We settle on the private data members first:

	Each OneDWalker instance needs to know

		its location

		its speed (as an order of magnitude)

	Here's the corresponding C++ code:

	class OneDWalker {
        	private:
                	double x, dx;
		public:
	};


<h3>Adding the public data members to the class definition</h3>

	Each public member function must have at least a prototype
	in the public portion of the class body

	A minimal class body would be as follows:

	class OneDWalker {
        	public:
                	static const int DEFAULT_LOCATION = 50;
                	static const int AVERAGE_SPEED = 5;
                	OneDWalker();
                	double getLocation();
                	void printLocation();
                	void drawLocation(string label);
                	void step();
                	void changeSpeed();
        	private:
                	double x, dx;
	};


<h3>Header and implementation files of a class</h3>

	Bodies for the public data members can be provided in either 
	the class body itself, or in a separate implementation file

	If a separate file is used:

		header file will be named ClassName.h

		header file will be named ClassName.cxx

                the line

                        #include "ClassName.h"

                must appear in the implementation file


<h3>Header file for the OneDWalker class</h3>

// OneDWalker.h, by Sergio A. Alvarez
// Header file for the C++ class OneDWalker whose instances 
// represent point objects that move randomly along a line.
// Note that this file contains only the class outline with 
// function prototypes; implementations are in a separate file.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class OneDWalker {
	public:
	/**
	* public data members
	*/
		// default parameters; static means that they 
		// are shared by all OneDWalker instances
		static const int DEFAULT_LOCATION = 50;
		static const int AVERAGE_SPEED = 5;
	/**
	* constructors
	*/
		// creates a new OneDWalker with location DEFAULT_LOCATION
		OneDWalker();

	/**
	* selector member functions
	*/
		// returns the recipient's current location
		double getLocation() const;

		// prints the recipient's current location
		void printLocation() const;

		// prints the argument string on the current line in the
		// console window, starting at recipient's current location
		void drawLocation(string label) const;

	/**
	* modifier member functions
	*/
		// changes recipient's location by an amount
		// proportional to its speed
		void step();

		// changes the recipient's speed by a random amount
		// proportional to the value AVERAGE_SPEED
		void changeSpeed();

	private:
	/**
	* private data members; each OneDWalker has its own copies of
	* these variables (also called instance variables); they cannot 
	* be accessed from a client program, except indirectly by calling
	* the member functions of the class
	*/
		double x, dx;
};

<h3>Implementing the public members of a class: full headers</h3>

	The implementation header of each public member of a class 
	must have the prefix

		ClassName::

	For example, the getLocation() function, which has the prototype:

                double getLocation();

	will have the following implementation header:

                double OneDWalker::getLocation()


<h3>Implementing the public members of a class: function bodies</h3>

	The public member functions of a class provide access to
	the private data members

	Consider the getLocation() function: it simply returns the 
	private data member x, as follows:

	double OneDWalker::getLocation() {
		return x;
	}

	Notice that x is not declared anywhere in the getLocation() function;
	instead, it is declared in the private portion of the class body


<h3>Which object's x is it?</h3>

	Suppose you have two OneDWalkers, steppy and jumpy, in a client program

	What happens when one of them is sent the getLocation() message?

	According the the getLocation() code, the value of x is returned

		but which x is it, steppy's? jumpy's?

		answer: it's the x of whoever received the message


<h3>The "this" pointer</h3>

	One may write the body of the getLocation() function in a way
	that makes explicit the fact that x is a member of some object

	One uses the word "this" to get a pointer (reference) to the
	object that received the message

	double OneDWalker::getLocation() {
		return this -&gt; x;
	}


<h3>Selector (const) vs. modifier member functions</h3>

        Some member functions provide read-only access to internal data

                these are known as selector (or accessor, or const) functions

        Other member functions provide read/write access to internal data

                these are known as modifier (or mutator) functions

        The read-only nature of selector functions can be enforced syntactically: use the const keyword in the function header

                then the compiler will check that no attempt is made to change any of the recipient's data members in the function 

        Example: getLocation() is read-only, so use the following prototype:

                double getLocation() const;

        The full implementation would be:

                double OneDWalker::getLocation() const {
                        return this -&gt; x;                 
		}


<h3>Implementation file of the OneDWalker class</h3>

The remaining member functions should be implemented as was done for the getLocation() function above. The finished implementation file is shown below.

// OneDWalker.cxx, by Sergio A. Alvarez
// Implementation file for the OneDWalker class.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "OneDWalker.h"
using namespace std;

OneDWalker::OneDWalker() {
	this-&gt;x = DEFAULT_LOCATION;
	srand(time(0));
	this-&gt;changeSpeed();
}

double OneDWalker::getLocation() const {
	return this-&gt;x;
}

void OneDWalker::printLocation() const {
	printf("%f", this-&gt;getLocation());
}

void OneDWalker::drawLocation(string label) const {
	string s = "";
	for (int pos=0; pos&lt;this-&gt;getLocation(); pos++)
		s += " ";
	cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; label &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void OneDWalker::step() {
	this-&gt;x += this-&gt;dx;
	this-&gt;changeSpeed();
}

void OneDWalker::changeSpeed() {
	this-&gt;dx = 2*AVERAGE_SPEED*(rand()/(double)RAND_MAX-0.5);
}
