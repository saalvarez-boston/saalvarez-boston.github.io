<br>Container classes
</h1>

<pre>
	A container class stores items of a shared type

	Container classes are needed for data storage in scientific computing

	Different container classes have different access rules

	For example, consider defining a List class

		a List represents a linearly ordered sequence of elements

		like an array, but a List can grow:

			List mySeq = List();	// create an empty List
			mySeq.append(3);	// mySeq is now {3}
			mySeq.append(-10); 	// mySeq is now {3, -10}
			cout &lt;&lt; mySeq.length();	// prints 2


<h3>Recall: pointers allow dynamic memory allocation in C++</h3>

	int* values;		// declare pointer (address) variable
	values = new int[100];	// allocate 100 int locations from heap memory
	for (int pos=0; pos&lt;100; pos++)
		values[pos] = pos*pos;	// use array as desired
	delete [ ] values;	// release array memory back to the heap


<h3>Using dynamic memory in C++ classes</h3>

	Resizeable arrays are convenient data members for container classes

	One can implement a List of integers using a dynamic array as follows:

	class List {
		private:
			int* data;
			size_t capacity;
	};
		
	We'll build on this idea and provide a complete List implementation

<h3>
Member functions associated with dynamic memory data members: constructors
</h3>

	The constructor function(s) must allocate new memory for members

		List::List() {
			data = new int[DEFAULT_CAPACITY]; // more needed (below)
		}

<h3>
Member functions associated with dynamic memory data members: copy constructors
</h3>

	A copy constructor must allow copying an existing object of the class

	Copy constructors have a similar header to ordinary constructors,
	but copy constructors accept a member of the class as an argument

	Note that copy constructor parameter must be const reference parameter

		List::List(const List& model) {
			data = model.data;	// will this work as is? more below
		}

<h3>
Member functions associated with dynamic memory data members: destructors
</h3>

	A special destructor function must release memory that is not needed

		usually called "automatically", to destroy local variables

		e.g.,

		void clientFunction() {
			List myList = List();
			myList.append(2);
			cout &lt;&lt;"Created a list of length " &lt;&lt;myList.length();
		}

		when the function exits, the destructor is called
		in order to destroy the local variable myList

	The name of the destructor is ~ClassName()

	Like the constructors, the destructor has no return type
	
		List::~List() {
			delete [ ] data;	// more needed; see below
		}

<h3>
Header file (public interface) for the List class
</h3>

// Program: List.h, by Sergio A. Alvarez
// Header file for first version of an instantiable List class
// Each List represents a linearly ordered sequence of int values.
// Lists provide random (indexed) access to elements using int get(size_t),
// as well as insertion at the end of the List using void append(int);
// a size_t length() function returns the number of elements of a List.
// Internal representation is based on a dynamically allocated array;
// constructor and destructor functions deal with dynamic memory issues.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class List {

	public:

		static const size_t DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 10;

	/** 
	* constructors 
	*/
		// creates a List with the given initial capacity
		List(int);

		// creates a List with initial capacity DEFAULT_CAPACITY
		List();

		// copy constructor: creates a copy of the argument List
		List(const List&);

	/** 
	* destructor 
	*/
		// releases the memory allocated for this List
		~List();

	/** 
	* selectors
	*/
		// returns the number of elements of the recipient List
		size_t length() const;

		// displays the elements of the recipient List
		void println() const;

		// returns element of recipient List with the given location
		int get(size_t) const;

	/** 
	* modifiers
	*/
		// adds the argument at the end of the recipient List
		void append(int);

	private:
		// storage array for this List
		int* data;
		// first available position in the data array
		size_t nextPos;
		// size of the data array
		size_t capacity;
		// helper method to increase the size of the data array
		void increaseCapacity();
};

<h3>
Internal representation for the List class
</h3>

	The basic object is a dynamically allocated array:

		int* data;

	We'll also need to keep track of the array's size:

		size_t capacity;

	Notice that only part of the array may have been used;
	therefore, we'll need to keep track of the size of the valid portion:

		size_t nextPos;		// first unused position in data

<h3>
Constructor implementation
</h3>

	Remember that constructors must initialize all data members

                // creates a List with the given initial capacity
                List::List(int initCap) {
                        capacity = initCap;
                        data = new int[initCap];
                        nextPos = 0;
                }

                // creates a List with initial capacity DEFAULT_CAPACITY
                List::List() {
                        List(DEFAULT_CAPACITY);
                }

<h3>
Copy constructor implementation
</h3>

	Copy constructors must copy the argument object exactly

	Obvious approach is as follows:

                // copy constructor: creates a copy of the argument List
                List::List(const List& given) {
                        data = given.data;
			capacity = given.capacity;
                        nextPos = given.nextPos;
                }

	Oops!

	By setting data = given.data, 
	the two pointers point to the same area of memory

	If either object is modified, both objects will be

		e.g., 
		List myList = List(given);
		given.data[1] = 12;
		cout &lt;&lt; myList.get(1);	// prints 12

	A correct copy constructor must allocate *new* memory,
	and then copy the old contents into the new memory

                // copy constructor: creates a copy of the argument List
                List::List(const List& given) {
                        capacity = given.capacity;
                        data = new int[capacity];
                        nextPos = given.nextPos;
                        for (int pos=0; pos&lt;nextPos; pos++)
                                data[pos] = given.data[pos];
                }

<h3>
Destructor implementation
</h3>

                // releases the memory allocated for this List
                List::~List() {
                        delete [ ] data;
                        capacity = 0;
                        nextPos = 0;
                }

<h3>
Implementing the List selector member functions
</h3>

	There are no surprises in the selector member functions

                // returns the number of elements of the recipient List
                size_t List::length() const {
                        return nextPos;
                }

                // displays the elements of the recipient List
                void List::println() const {
                        for (int pos=0; pos&lt;nextPos; pos++)
                                cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; data[pos];
                        cout &lt;&lt; endl;
                }

                // returns element of recipient List with the given location
                int List::get(size_t pos) const {
                        return data[pos];
                }

<h3>
Implementing the List modifier member functions (append)
</h3>

	Natural way to implement the append function

		just add the argument in the first unused position:

                // adds the argument at the end of the recipient List
                void List::append(int elem) {
                        data[nextPos] = elem;
                }

	Oops - forgot to update the nextPos variable!

                // adds the argument at the end of the recipient List
                void List::append(int elem) {
                        data[nextPos] = elem;
                        nextPos++;
                }

<h3>
Need to increase capacity
</h3>

	The above still doesn't work!

		it fails when the data array is already full

	Care must be taken not to go beyond the currently allocated memory

		the capacity of the array must be increased as needed

                // adds the argument at the end of the recipient List
                void List::append(int elem) {
                        if (nextPos &gt;= capacity)
                                increaseCapacity();
                        data[nextPos] = elem;
                        nextPos++;
                }

	The increaseCapacity() function does the heavy lifting:

                void List::increaseCapacity() {
                        int* newData = new int[2*capacity];
                        for (int pos=0; pos&lt;nextPos; pos++)
                                newData[pos] = data[pos];
                        delete [ ] data;
                        data = newData;
                        capacity = 2*capacity;
                }

<h3>
Summary so far
</h3>

	Dynamic arrays are natural internal data members for container classes

		we've looked at a List class
		other container classes may be built in this way too

	Special care must be taken with dynamic memory when implementing:

		constructors
		copy constructors
		modifiers
		destructors
		
<p><hr><p>

<h3>
Another container class: Stack
</h3>

        A stack is a container with Last In First Out (LIFO) access

        Like a stack of plates:

                you can push an item onto the top of the stack

                you can remove the item at the top of the stack

                you cannot access other items unless you remove
                all of the items above that item first

        To push a new item

                s.push(elem);

        To get the top item (read-only (selector) function):

                s.top();

        To remove the top item:

                s.pop();

	We'll assume that the stack elements are chars for now

<h3>
First stack example: checking whether a string is symmetric
</h3>

        scan the string from left to right, pushing each char onto a stack

        then scan again, comparing each char with the char at the
        top of the stack, popping the top after each comparison

<h3>
Checking whether a string is symmetric: code
</h3>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "Stack.h"
using namespace std;

string readLine(string prompt);

int main() {
        Stack s;
        string text = readLine("Enter some text: ");
        for (int pos=0; pos&lt;text.length(); pos++)
                s.push(text[pos]);
        for (int pos=0; pos&lt;text.length(); pos++) {
                if (s.top() != text[pos]) {
                        cout &lt;&lt;"Sorry, that's not a symmetric string" &lt;&lt;endl;
                        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
                }
                s.pop();
        }
        cout &lt;&lt;"Yes - a symmetric string!" &lt;&lt;endl;
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

string readLine(string prompt) {
        cout &lt;&lt;prompt;
        string s;
        getline(cin, s, '\n');
        return s;
}

<h3>
Implementing the Stack class
</h3>

	We can actually reuse a lot of the List class code

	Internal representation is the same

	Many methods are similar

<h3>
Notes on the Stack-specific methods
</h3>

	The top of the Stack is just the last valid array element

                // returns the element at the top of the recipient Stack
                char Stack::top() const {
                        return data[nextPos-1];
                }

	Popping the top doesn't even require modifying the array;
	just update the nextPos variable appropriately

                // removes the element at the top of the recipient Stack
                void Stack::pop() {
                        nextPos--;
                }

	Pushing an element onto the top of the Stack is just like appending it

                // adds the argument at the top of the recipient Stack
                void Stack::push(char elem) {
                        if (nextPos &gt;= capacity)
                                increaseCapacity();
                        data[nextPos] = elem;
                        nextPos++;
                }

<p><hr><p>

<h3>
A third container class: Queue
</h3>

	Queues provide containers with First In First Out (FIFO) access

	Like the check-out line at a store

<h3>
Public interface of the Queue class
</h3>

	I note only the differences relative to the List and Stack classes

                // returns the element at the front of the recipient Queue
                string front() const;

                // returns the element at the rear of the recipient Queue
                string rear() const;

                // adds the argument at the rear of the recipient Queue
                void insert(string);

                // removes the element at the front of the recipient Queue
                void remove();

<h3>
Implementing the Queue class
</h3>

	Queues are trickier than the other container classes

	We'll still use a dynamic array as the main storage 

	The fact that you insert at one end and remove at the other
	requires that we think about what part of the array to use

		if we add new elements at the high end of the array,
		then we'll need to remove them at the low end
		(and vice-versa)

		we'll need to either shuffle things down to the
		beginning (or end) of the array, or else we'll
		need to keep track of *two* positions

	Given the time needed to do the shuffling, we choose the latter

<h3>
Data representation
</h3>

	class Queue {
        	private:
                	// storage array for this Queue
                	string* data;
                	// position of the front element in the data array
                	size_t frontPos;
                	// first position after rear element in the data array
                	size_t rearPos;
                	// size of the data array
                	size_t capacity;
	};

	Initially, both frontPos and rearPos will be 0

	When an element is inserted at the rear of the Queue,
	rearPos increases by 1

	When an element is removed at the front of the Queue,
	frontPos increases by 1

	Note that rearPos and frontPos may eventually "wrap around" the end of the data array

<h3>
Sample member functions: front() and rear()
</h3>

	Assuming the Queue is not empty, the front element is the one located at position frontPos of the data array:

                // returns the element at the front of the recipient Queue
                string Queue::front() const {
                        return data[frontPos];
                }

	Since rearPos is the first position *after* the rear element, the rear element is located in the position 
	immediately preceding rearPos. You might think the following works:

                // returns the element at the rear of the recipient Queue
                string Queue::rear() const {
                        return data[rearPos-1];	//oops
                }

	However, rearPos may well be 0 even if the Queue is not empty.
	In that case, you must "wrap around" to the end of the data array:

                // returns the element at the rear of the recipient Queue
                string Queue::rear() const {
			if (rearPos &gt; 0)
                        	return data[rearPos-1];
			else
                        	return data[capacity-1];
                }

	Trick: you can combine the two cases by using the modular remainder operator % to wrap around automatically, as follows:

                // returns the element at the rear of the recipient Queue
                string Queue::rear() const {
                        return data[(rearPos-1)%capacity];
                }

<h3>
Sample member functions: size()
</h3>

	Again, there are two cases:

		if rearFront &gt;= frontPos (e.g. front 2, rear 8, capacity 20), 

			return rearFront-frontPos

		else (e.g. front 10, rear 8, capacity 20),

			return capacity+rearPos-frontPos

	You can combine the two cases using modular remainder to
	wrap around automatically:

                // returns the number of elements of the recipient Queue
                size_t Queue::size() const {
                        return (capacity+rearPos-frontPos)%capacity;
                }


Try implementing the other Queue member functions!
Note that care is required when resizing the data array in order not to 
introduce invalid elements in the range between the frontPos and rearPos positions.
