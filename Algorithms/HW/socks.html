<h3>Solution to Problem #1</h3>

Here's the rather obvious solution. 
Sort the items in order of decreasing value, from the $1$st to the $2n$-th.
Then pair off consecutive items, starting with the first two. Thus, you
should pay the full price for items with odd indices and the discounted
price for items with even indices.
<p>
Now we give a proof that this is indeed the optimal strategy.
It is clear that the total discount depends only on which items
are discounted. Thus, we focus our attention on the indices of the 
discounted items. We call such indices the {\em discounted indices}, 
and we list them in increasing order as $i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_n$.
<p>
Each pairing of the items produces a set of discounted indices.
The pairing proposed above satisfies $i_k = 2k$ for all $k=1,..,n$.
We claim that for <i>any</i> admissible pairing, one must have $i_k >= 2k$
for all $k$. We will prove this below. Observe that this claim implies 
that the proposed strategy is optimal, since the value of the $i$-th item 
is a decreasing function of the index $i$, so that the savings associated 
with any admissible pairing will be less than the savings associated with 
the proposed pairing, which achieves the minimum allowable values of the 
discounted indices.
<p>
Proving that $i_k >= 2k$ for any admissible pairing is quite easy.
Admissibility reduces to the constraint that each discounted index
be paired with a nondiscounted index corresponding to an item of
equal or greater value, i.e. with a nondiscounted index which is 
less than or equal to the given discounted index. Thus, since there
are precisely $k$ discounted indices which are less than or equal to
the $k$-th discounted index $i_k$, there must also be at least $k$ 
associated nondiscounted indices less than or equal to $i_k$. 
But the total number of nondiscounted indices in the range
$1,...,i_k$ is precisely $i_k - k$. We must therefore have
$i_k - k >= k$, or $i_k >= 2k$.
