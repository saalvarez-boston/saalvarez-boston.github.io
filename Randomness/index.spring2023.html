<h3>What this course is about</h3>
</a>
CSCI 2244 provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and tools that 
enable advanced work in modeling and computation involving randomness. The 
focus is on discrete probability. Topics include probability spaces, random 
variables, conditional probability, limit theorems, and Markov chains. 
Selected topics in linear algebra are discussed in connection with the 
analysis of covariance. Randomness in the sense of algorithmic succinctness 
(e.g., Kolmogorov complexity) is mentioned in passing, but is not discussed 
at length. Computational illustrations in Python are given throughout the course.

<p>

<a name="prereq">
<h3>Prerequisites / Required Background</h3>
</a>
<b>The official prerequisites for CSCI 2244 are Computer Science I (CSCI 1101)
and calculus (MATH 1102/1103 or equivalent).</b>
In particular, students entering CSCI 2244 should be
comfortable with fundamental programming techniques, as well 
as with basic concepts of differential and integral calculus. 
Writing short programs in Python will be required in some of the problem sets.
Please <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install Python 3.9 or higher</a>, if you don't already have it.
<p>
By the way, if your CS1 course did not use Python as the programming language, 
don't panic. Python is easy to learn, and you won't need all of its features
right away. 
See <a href="https://docs.python.org/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/tutorial/</a> to get started. 
<p>
<a name="strategy">
<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</a>
<i>This is a challenging course.</i> You should plan to work hard,
to keep up with the reading assignments, and to start problem sets 
early. Engage with the course material, in class and out.
<!--
are two key habits
that should be developed (if necessary) and maintained for the 
entirety of the course.
-->
<p>
Assigned reading will usually follow the in-lecture discussion
fairly closely, but there may be a few exceptions to this rule.
Therefore, it is important to make sure that you've understood 
all of the the material covered in the lectures in addition to 
that in the reading assignments. <i>I cannot overstate the
importance of conscientiously doing all of the problem sets
in order to master the course material</i>.
When preparing problem set solutions, you should strive for
maximum clarity. Your write-ups should reveal the key ingredients 
and the structure of your reasoning. Include detailed explanations.
These comments apply equally to exam solutions.
<p>
I'll be happy to discuss any questions during my regular office hours,
and encourage you to attend our TAs' office hours, as well. 
If you can't make it to my office hours, please contact me by e-mail so 
that we can try to schedule an appointment at a mutually convenient time.

<!--
<p>
<h4>No networked devices policy</h4>
<i>The use of portable computers (laptops, tablets) or phones is not permitted
in class.</i> Prior experience suggests that such devices can be distracting
and detrimental to learning, both for the user and for others around him / her.
Computational experimentation with the course material outside of class is 
highly encouraged.
-->

<p><hr><p>

<a name="grading">
<h3>Grading</h3>
</a>

The course grade will be based on problem sets, exams, and participation.

<ul>

<p><li> Problem sets will be due on Canvas most Fridays 
(but check each problem set statement for possible exceptions). 
<i>You must submit at least six problem sets that demonstrate a serious 
attempt at completion in order to be eligible for a passing grade in the 
course.</i> 
Each problem set will be posted approximately one week before the due date. 
<p>
<i>Late submissions will receive no credit except in very unusual 
circumstances</i> (at the discretion of the instructor). 
On the other hand, <i>I will drop your lowest homework grade</i>, 
such as a zero from a missed assignment, no questions asked.  
<!--
and reduce your resilience to unexpected events later on (leading to low problem set
scores that would count toward your final grade).
-->
The average score on the problem sets will contribute 10% of your course grade. 
More importantly, however, your work on the problem sets will be crucial
in developing a mastery of the material.
Think twice before deciding to skip a problem set or not do it fully,
as this would negatively impact your performance on exams.

<p><li>Three exams will be given before the end of classes
(see the schedule for dates). 
The exams will cover material from class, from the problem sets, 
and from the book. You may use your own cheat sheet
(single-sided sheet of letter-sized paper of your own notes) during exams. 
<i>No sharing of materials or information is allowed.</i>
The average of each student's exam scores will contribute 
80% of their course grade.
<p>
Brief quizzes may also be given during some class periods,
possibly without prior notice.  
The overall quiz score will count as 10% of the course grade.
<p>
There will be no make-up exams or quizzes. 
In order to allow for unexpected events, I will drop each student's 
lowest quiz score.
<p>
<b>
Do not be fooled by the low weight given to homework scores in the overall
grade, relative to exams and quizzes. The not-so-secret recipe for doing well on the latter is to work diligently on the problem sets and to stay up to date on the course material.
</b>

<p><li>My assessment of each student's level of participation in the course
may enter into deciding the final grade in cases in which a student's
overall score puts them on the boundary between two letter grades.

<!--
<p><li>
My assessment of your class participation may be 
-->
<!--
<p><li>A written final exam (see schedule below for
date and time) will count as 30% of your course grade.
-->

<!--
<p><li>In-class activities and participation will count as 
10% of your course grade. Occasional pop quizzes or unannounced 
discussions of the current reading assignment may be held and
would contribute to this part of your grade.
-->

</ul>

<p>

<a name="honesty">
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
</a>
You are encouraged to discuss assigned homework problems (but not exams) 
with other people but you must individually design and write your own 
solutions for all assignments. Furthermore, you should explicitly 
acknowledge any sources of ideas used that are not your own; this includes 
other people, chatbots, books, web sites, etc. 
You should not discuss exam problems with anyone except the instructor. 
Please also read the

Boston College academic integrity policy</a>.
Behavior that is not in the spirit of 
the above guidelines may be reported to the appropriate class dean for 
review by the Academic Integrity Board.
<!--will be considered to be a violation of the honor code.-->

particular situation, talk to me.
