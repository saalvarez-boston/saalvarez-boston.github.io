Random Variables (week 6)

	2) Poisson arrivals: let X = # of arrivals in unit time, 
	for mean arrival rate lambda

	Distribution of X is: 

		P(X=k) = lambda^k/k! e^(-lambda)

	Expected value:

		E(X) = sum_(k>=1) e^(-lambda) lambda^k/(k-1)!

			= lambda sum_{j>=0} e^(-lambda) lambda^j / j!

	The sum is 1, though, because it is the sum of all of the
	values of a Poisson distribution, so:

		E(X) = lambda, the mean arrival rate (of course!)

	Now the variance:

		var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2

	Compute the first term on the right:

		E(X^2) = sum_(k>=1) e^(-lambda) lambda^k/(k-1)! k

			= lambda sum_{j>=0} e^(-lambda) lambda^j / j! (j+1)

	Split into two sums, which have values lambda E(X) and lambda*1, so:

		E(X^2) = lambda^2 + lambda

	and

		var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = lambda^2 + lambda - lambda^2 = lambda


Properties of expected value and variance

	Expected value is linear: 

		E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)

	Variance is quadratic, and produces interaction terms: 

		var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2(E(XY) - E(X)E(Y))


Independent random variables

	RV's X and Y are called independent if all pairs of events

		{X=v} and {Y=w}

	are independent.

	Thus, if X and Y are independent, then for any values v, w:

		P(X=v and Y=w) = P(X=v)*P(Y=w)

	If X and Y are independent, then E(XY) splits:

		E(XY) = sum_{i,j} pi qj vi wj = E(X)E(Y)

	(here, pi = P(X=vi) and qj = P(Y=wj))

	In this case, the variance of X+Y is just the sum of their variances:

		var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y)
