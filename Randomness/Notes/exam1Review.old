	the week 1 summary notes, and the textbook


1) Random experiments as specified by a sample space of all possible outcomes
and a probability function on the sample space

	sample task format 1) for a given informal description of a random 
	experiment or a random event, specify a sample space that provides 
	a good model for the given situation; perhaps choose a sample space 
	for which all outcomes are equally likely to occur

	example: consider the random event "a two-card hand dealt from 
	a single standard deck of 52 cards in four suits contains cards 
	from two different suits"

	here are two sample spaces S that are reasonable models of the 
	associated random experiment:

	option A) Consider outcomes to be all unordered sets of two cards 
	taken from a single deck; there are "52 choose 2" such sets, 
	abbreviated 52C2, all of which are equally likely.

	option B) Consider outcomes to be all ordered sequences of two cards 
	taken from a single deck; there are 52*51 such permutations,
	abbreviated 52P2, all of which are equally likely.

	By the way, notice that sample space B is twice the size of
	sample space A, so that its outcomes are one-half as likely 
	to occur. Why would this not lead to different values for the 
	probability of the event of interest in the two models?

	Also see PS1, task 1; PS2, tasks 2a and 4a.


2) Random events as collections of outcomes in some sample space

	sample task format 2) Given the description of a sample space and
	an event of interest, specify the outcomes of the sample space that
	contribute to (i.e., belong to) the event of interest.

	example: Consider the above example. Let E be the event of interest,
	that is, E is the event that exactly two suits are represented in a
	random two-card hand drawn from a single deck. What outcomes are in 
	the set that defines this event? The answer depends on what sample 
	space is being used. We consider options A and B as described above.

	option A) If the outcomes are unordered pairs of cards, then E is the 
	set of unordered pairs of cards of different suits. How many such 
	unordered pairs are there? First, there are 4C2 = 6 ways to select two 
	suits from among the four possible suits; having selected a pair of 
	suits, there are 13 x 13 pairs of cards of those particular suits.

	option B) If the outcomes are ordered pairs of cards, then E is the 
	set of ordered pairs of cards of different suits. How many such ordered 
	pairs are there? First, there are 4C2 = 6 ways to select two suits from 
	among the four possible suits; having selected a pair of suits, there 
	are 2P2 = 2 ways to order those two suits; having selected and ordered 
	the two suits, there are 13 x 13 pairs of cards of those particular 
	suits in that particular order.

	As you can see, the event E as represented in sample space B is twice 
	the size of the event E as represented in sample space A. Therefore,
	the probability of event E is the same when computed in either of the
	two sample spaces, since the sizes of the sample spaces are in the
	same 1:2 ratio.

	Also see PS2, tasks 2b and 4b.


3) Calculation of probabilities

	sample task format 3) given an informal description of a random
	event E, first find a suitable sample space that models the associated
	random experiment (as in task format 1, above), then find the outcomes
	that corrsepond to the specific event E (as in task format 2, above),
	and then calculate the probability of the event E.

	example: consider the probability of getting two different suits in a
	random pair of cards drawn from a single deck. We can model the random
	experiment using either of the two sample spaces A, B described above.
	As we saw, the choice of a sample space also affects the specific
	makeup of the set that represents the event of interest: the set E
	consists of half as many outcomes in sample space A than in sample
	space B. We pick one of these two sample spaces, say A, in which
	outcomes are unordered pairs of two different cards. As discussed
	above, we know the following facts:

		the size of sample space A is 52C2 = 52 * 51 / 2 = 26 * 51

		the size of event E is 4C2 * 13 * 13 = 6 * 13 * 13

	Since all outcomes in A are equally likely, the probability of E is:

		P(E) = |E| / |A| = 6 * 13 * 13 / (26 * 51)

	If you want to distill this expression down to a numerical value,
	simplification is in order:

		P(E) = 3 * 26 * 13 / (26 * 51) = 39 / 51 = 13 / 17

	Since 17 is about 4/3 of 13, a rough estimate of this value is 0.75.

4) MATLAB basics

	sample task format 4) write a single MATLAB statement (or perhaps 
	a short MATLAB script) that performs a given computational task

	example: simulate a sequence of 100 trials, each consisting of 20
	tosses of a loaded coin with P(heads) = 0.7, using the rand function;
	the result should be a vector named sim of size 100 x 20.

	Here is a single MATLAB statement that achieves the desired goal:

		sim = (rand(100,20) < 0.7);
