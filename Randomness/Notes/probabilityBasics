Equally likely outcomes

	Suppose that a sample space, S, consists of a finite number, n, 
	of equally likely outcomes

		each outcome has probability 1/n (why?)

	The probability of any event E then reduces to counting, because:

		P(E) = sum over x in E of P(x) = sum over x of 1/n = |E|/n


Examples of probability calculations in the case of equally likely outcomes

	1) The probability of getting the Ace of Hearts in 
	a random two-card hand dealt from a single deck

		Here, the sample space S consists of all pairs of cards
		from a single deck. There are 1326 such pairs (why: later).
		Each pair therefore has probability 1/1326

		The Ace of Hearts appears in exactly 51 such hands. Why?

		=> P(Ace of Hearts in hand) = 51/1326 = 1/26

	2) The probability that you'll see tails at least once
	in two flips of a fair coin

		S = {(s,s') | s,s' in {H,T}}
		P(s,s') = 1/4
		P(tails at least once) = 1 - one outcome/4 = 3/4
	

Continuous probability

	A random experiment is continuous if it involves an uncountable 
	infinity of outcomes, such as a continous range of real numbers

		examples include measuring the temperature of a mixture

			possible outcomes = all real numbers between 0 and 400

		and throwing a dart at a target

			possible outcomes = all points on the wall

		continuous probability requires rethinking the nature of the
		probability function, because the probability of an individual
		outcome of a continuous random experiment is typically zero!

Redefining the notion of probability function for continuous sample spaces

	if the set of outcomes is an interval of real numbers,
	then one can state the probability of every subinterval

		for instance, if one is randomly throwing darts at the
		interval [0,10], then the probability of a subinterval 
		[a,b] should be proportional to the length b-a: 

			P([a,b]) = C*(b-a), where C is some fixed value

		In order for the set of all outcomes, [0,10], to have
		probability 1, as it should:

			1 = C*(10-0) = 10C => C = 1/10

			=> P([a,b]) = (b-a)/10

The general definition of probability space

	We had started by stating that a random experiment is defined by
	a sample space S of all possible experimental outcomes together with
	a non-negative probability function P on the sample space S, with the
	only additional restriction that

		sum of P(x) over all x in S equals 1

	However, we know that if the sample space is continuous then
	each P(x) could actually be 0.

	We dealt with this case by instead viewing the probability function 
	as being defined on certain sets of outcomes, like intervals,
	instead of on individual outcomes. In the special case of discrete
	probability, this new definition is consistent with the old one.

	This leads to the general definition of probability space as
	consisting of a set S, called the sample space, whose elements
	represent the possible experimental outcomes, together with a
	probability function P defined on subsets of S, and satisfying
	the following properties:

		P(E) >= 0 for all subsets E of S
		P(S) = 1 (this replaces the summing to 1 property)
