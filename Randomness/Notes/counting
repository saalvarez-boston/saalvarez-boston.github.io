Counting, permutations, combinations (weeks 2-3)


Equally likely outcomes

	If all outcomes in a sample space S are equally likely, then

		P(x) = 1/|S| for each elementary outcome x in S

		P(E) = |E| / |S| for all subsets E of S

	Therefore, calculating the probability of an event reduces to
	counting the number of outcomes in that event


Fundamental principles of counting

	1) Partition principle: 
	if A1...An are nonoverlapping sets, then |U Ai| = sum of |Ai|

	2) Multiplication principle: 
	if A1...An are any sets (overlapping or not), then the set of all 
	ordered n-tuples (a1...an), where each ai is in Ai, has exactly 
	|A1| x |A2| x ... x |An| elements

	2') Multiplication principle, extended version: 
	if there are m1 different choices for the first element of a tuple,
	and m2 different choices for the second element of the tuple,
	and in general mi different choices for the i-th element, 1 <= i <= n,
	then the total number of different possible n-tuples is the product
	m1 x m2 x ... x mn


Examples of the fundamental principles of counting

	1) Number of different license plates of the form nnnn-LL
	(four digits followed by two letters):

		by the multiplication principle, this equals
		10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 26 x 26 = 5,760,000


	2) Number of different five-letter "words" that start with "car":

		by the multiplication principle, this equals
		1 x 1 x 1 x 26 x 26 = 576


	3) Probability that a randomly selected three-letter word is "car":

		we consider the sample space of all three-letter "words"
		
		by the multiplication principle, this space contains
		precisely 26 x 26 x 26 = 17,576 outcomes

		random selection means that all of these outcomes are 
		equally likely, hence each has probability 1/17576

		"car" is just one of these outcomes...

		by the way, we therefore expect one occurrence of the
		word "car" in every 17576 repetitions of the random
		experiment of selecting a random three-letter word

		what if we consider a random sequence of one million letters?
		looking for "car" as a subsequence corresponds to approximately
		one million repetitions of this experiment (one for each start
		position between 1 and 999,998); hence, we expect to see "car"
		about 1,000,000 / 17,576 = 57 times, and we do!


	4) Number of two-card hands, both of the same suit, drawn from the same deck:

		A hand is not an ordered sequence, but rather an unordered set;
		however, we can count ordered sequences of two Hearts and then
		just divide by two at the end to account for the redundancy

		By the additon principle, the number of single-suit hands is
		the sum of the numbers of Hearts hands, Diamonds hands,
		Spades hands, and Clubs hands

		A single deck contains 13 cards of each of the four suits

		Once a card of a given suit has been chosen for a hand,
		there are only 12 other cards of that suit left
	
		Hence, by the multiplication principle, there are 13 x 12 = 156
		different two-card sequences of each suit, or 156/2 = 78
		different two-card hands

		We conclude that the total number of single-suit two-card hands
		taken from a single deck is 4 x 78 = 312
		

Permutations and combinations

	We asked how many three-card single-suit hands there are

	We saw that if we count ordered sequences of three cards,
	then each hand gets counted six times

		abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba

	These reorderings are called (full length) permutations

	Another example is the number of orders in which a given
	group of people can line up

	How many permutations does a given set S have?

	Answer depends on the size, n, of S

	We'll let PermSet(S) denote the set of all permutations of a set S
	and Perm(n) denote the number of permutations of any set of size n


A formula for Perm(m)

	List elements of S as a1, a2, ..., an

	We can split the permutations into subsets depending on
	what element of S they start with

		PermSet(S) = U Si, where Si contains all sequences that start with ai

	These subsets Si do not overlap, so by the addition principle:

		|PermSet(S)| = sum of all of the |Si|

	Since all Si have the same size, we see that

		|PermSet(S)| = n times the number of elements of any one of the Si

	But each Si has as many elements as there are permutations of
	a set of n-1 elements:

		|Si| = Perm(n-1)

	so we get the following relationship:

		Perm(n) = n Perm(n-1)

	If you reason along the same lines again, you unravel Perm(n-1):

		Perm(n) = n (n-1) Perm(n-2)

	Keep doing this, and you get

		Perm(n) = n(n-1)(n-2) ... Perm(1) = n(n-1)...1

	The product on the right is called "n factorial" and is
	also denoted n!


Short permutations

	You can consider sequences of length k of elements from a set of size n

	These are called permutations of n objects taken k at a time

	For example, consider five-letter words with no repeated letters
	over the alphabet A-Z

	These are permutations of 26 letters taken 5 at a time

	If you repeat letters, you're not considering permutations

	We let Perm(n,k) denote the number of permutations of n taken k at a time

		e.g., Perm(26,5) for 5-letter words without repetitions

	What is the value of Perm(n,k)?

	Multiplication principle again:

		n choices for first

		n-1 choices for second

		...

	so total number is product n(n-1)...(n-k+1)

	Example, the length 2 permutations of the set {Peter, Paul, Mary}
	are:
		Peter, Paul
		Peter, Mary
		Paul, Peter
		Paul, Mary
		Mary, Peter
		Mary, Paul

	which is consistent with the formula

		Perm(3,2) = 3(3-2) = 6


Combinations

	What if you don't care about the order?

	For example, you have to pick two people from {Peter,Paul,Mary}
	to represent the group at a meeting

	The possible such unordered pairs is:

		Peter, Paul
		Peter, Mary
		Paul, Mary

	Notice that each such so-called combination corresponds to
	two different permutations

	which in fact gives us a general way to compute the number of combinations


A formula for the number of combinations

	We let (n,k) denote the number of different size-k (unordered) subsets
	of a set of n elements, and call this "n choose k"

		e.g., (3,2) is the number of pairs from {Peter,Paul,Mary},
		so (3,2)=3

	We need a formula for (n,k)

	We get it by figuring out how many permutations you can get
	from any one given combination:

		well, given k elements, you can reorder them in k! ways

	so, we know that

		Perm(n,k) = k! (n,k)

	so

		(n,k) = Perm(n,k) / k! 

	By the way, notice that

		Perm(n,k) = n! / (n-k)!

	so

		(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)


Properties of combinatorial numbers

	(n,0) = 1 and (n,n) = 1

	symmetry

		let's plot n choose k for n=10, k=0:10

		looks like it's symmetrical; is it?

		check that

			(n,k) = (n, n-k)

	Pascal's triangle

		(n,k) = (n,k-1) + (n-1,k)


Binomial expansion

	look at (a + b)^n

	if you expand it, you get products of terms taken n at a time

	some terms are a, the rest are b

	if k are a's and n-k are b's, then get product a^k b^(n-k)

	there are exactly (n,k) ways of getting that particular result

	therefore,

		(a + b)^n = sum from k=0 to n of (n,k) a^k b^(n-k)


Probability calculations using combinations and permutations

	probability that two randomly selected people were born on same day of yar

	compute probability of different days of year:

	sample space is all days of year with P(i)=1/365 for each i=1...365

	P(all n days different) = Perm(365,n) / 365^n

				= 365*364* ... *(365-(n-1)) / 365^n

				= 1 (1-1/365) (1-2/365) ... (1 - (n-1)/365)

	Plot in MATLAB and examine
