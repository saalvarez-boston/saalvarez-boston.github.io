Prof. Alvarez


Final Exam Topics
(emphasis will be on establishing conceptual understanding, demonstrated by the 
ability to cast specific problems in the language of the course, and to solve them
using ideas and tools discussed in the course; knowing the terminology is important
to the extent that it enables doing these things)

	Probability basics: 

		random experiment, sample space, probability function

	Counting: 

		addition and multiplication principles
		hidden function trick
		combinations and permutations
		application to probability spaces with equiprobable outcomes

	Independence and conditional probability: 

		definition(s), conditioning
		Bayes' rule (diagnostic reasoning)

	Random variables: 
	
		definition, distributions (PMF,PDF,CDF)
		E(X), var(X)
		independence

	2D and nD random variables: 

		joint and marginal distributions
		independence, covariance, correlation

	Basic matrix algebra: 

		matrix operations, transposes
		inner and outer products
		multiplication of rectangular matrices
		behavior of covariance under linear transformations

	Eigenvectors and eigenvalues: 
	
		definitions, geometric meaning
		transposition

	Principal components analysis: 

		geometric significance and computation of principal axes
		projections
		high-D PCA using instancewise covariance

	Random processes: 

		definition
		i.i.d. processes, law of large numbers, central limit theorem
		Markov chain basics


Study materials

	The problem sets provide an excellent source of practice problems

		do them again; you may get more out of them the second time

	Solutions helpful also, but attempt the problems yourself first

	I've posted notes on many important topics

	Read the book, too
