CS244, Randomness and Computation
Prof. Alvarez


Summary of key topics discussed in class during the first week


Randomness

	unpredictability within a given instance of a random phenomenon

		like tossing a coin once

	but collective behavior over many repetitions of the experiment
	may allow nearly deterministic description

		like the global pattern visible in a large collection of random walks

Formal notion of random experiment / probability space

	must define precisely what set (sample space) of individual outcomes 
	are possible in any single instance of the experiment

		like {Heads, Tails} for tossing a coin once

		like {0,1,2,3,4,5,...} (all non-negative integers)
		for a single observation of the line length at the DMV

	but also, some measure of expected likelihood (probability) must be given

		why: we want to answer questions such as "is observing 60 or so 
		occurrences of the substring 'cat' plausible in a randomly generated 
		string of length one million?" or "what is the probability that there 
		will be at least three people in line at the DMV?"

		how: we assign a number P(x) between 0 and 1 (probability) to each 
		possible outcome x in the sample space, that measures the fraction 
		of experimental instances in which that particular outcome x is 
		expected to occur

			like P(i)=1/6 for each face i of a fair die

			like P(n) = e^(-rate) rate^n / n!, where n is the line length 
			at the DMV (by the way, n! means the product 1*2*...*n here)

		the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space is 1

Random events

	are subsets of the sample space, and correspond to events that may occur 
	or not depending on what experimental outcome occurs

		like rolling an even number on a die

			as a set: {2,4,6}

		like observing at least three people in line at the DMV

			as a set: {3,4,5,6,7,...} (all integers >= 3)

	the probability of an event should measure its expected relative frequency

		since outcomes in the sample space are mutually exclusive, it
		follows that the probability of an event E is the sum of the
		probabilities of its constituent outcomes

Properties of the probability function

	For any event, E, 

		0 <= P(E) <= 1

		P(E) = sum of all values P(x), over all x in E

	The probability of the entire sample space is 1

	If E and F are mutually exclusive events (cannot both occur in the
	same experimental instance; represented by non-intersecting sets),

		P(E or F occurs) = P(E) + P(F)

	Therefore, if E is any event,

		P(E does not occur) = 1 - P(E occurs)

MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) topics

	Provides an interactive environment for computing and visualization

	Uses vectors / matrices as the basic data objects, and is optimized to 
	do vector operations efficiently; explicit iteration is possible but 
	should not be the default technique

	Random number generators

		rand(n,m) returns a size n x m matrix (n rows, m columns)
		containing random floating-point values between 0 and 1

		randi(max, n, m) returns a random n x m matrix containing
		random integers between 1 and max

	Some other operators and functions that we used in class (see MATLAB help)

		colon operator to define index ranges, and as a wildcard

		sum, to add over a selected dimension of a matrix

		hist, for histograms

		findstr, for substring matching

		elementwise arithmetic: use . in front of operator

			like .^ for elementwise exponentiation

	M-files

		define scripts or functions

		see examples on course web page
