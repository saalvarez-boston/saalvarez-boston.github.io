Recall: covariance matrix of a 2D RV

		cov(X,X)	cov(X,Y)
	C = 
		cov(Y,X)	cov(Y,Y)

	Covariance doesn't change if the RVs X and Y are shifted by constants:

		cov(X+a, Y+b) = cov(X,Y)

	Why: use bilinearity as follows

		cov(X+a, Y+b) = cov(X,Y) + cov(a,Y) + cov(X,b) + cov(a,b)

				= cov(X,Y) because all other terms are 0

	So, if we are just interested in obtaining the covariance matrix,
	we can first shift the RVs involved so that their expected values are 0


Covariance matrix in terms of matrix multiplication

	Assume that (X,Y) has expected value 0, that is, [E(X) E(Y)] = [0 0]

	The covariance matrix of X,Y is then

			E(X^2)	E(XY)
		C =
			E(YX)	E(Y^2)

			X^2	XY
		= E (		     )
			YX	Y^2


		= E( [X Y]'*{X Y} )


Sample covariance matrix

	The above calculation refers to the exact distribution covariance

	If the covariance matrix is instead estimated based on sample data,
	then the expected values become averages over the sample points

	In matrix notation, the calculation of the sample covariance is:

					X'
		sample C = average of 	   * [X Y]
					Y'

	where now X and Y denote columns of data samples, so that X' and Y'
	are the corresponding rows of the same data samples

	Note carefully that even though all sample points are weighted equally
	in such an average, the underlying probability distributions are
	correctly taken into account, because a given value will occur among
	the samples in proportion to its probability


Effect of a linear transformation on the covariance matrix

	Suppose that [X Y] is a 2D RV with covariance matrix C

	Suppose that A is a 2x2 matrix

	Define a new 2D RV by matrix multiplication:

		[U V] = [X Y]*A

	How is the covariance matrix of [U V] determined in terms of C, A?

	We assume that [X Y] has expected value 0:

		[E(X) E(Y)] = [0 0]

	First calculate the expected value of [U V]:

		[E(U) E(V)] = E([U V]) = E( [X Y]*A ) = E([X Y])*A = [0 0]

	Nice. Now compute the covariance matrix of the new variables:

		Cnew = E([U V]*[U V]') = E( ([X Y]*A)'*[X Y]*A )

			= E( A'*[X Y]'*[X Y]*A )

			= A'*E([X Y]'*[X Y])*A 

			= A'*C*A


Example of the covariance matrix after a linear transformation

	Try some examples in MATLAB, as we did in class

	xy = randn(10^3,2);		independent Gaussians with mean 0, var 1

	scatter(xy(:,1), xy(:,2));	nice and symmetrical

	cov(xy)				what should this covariance matrix be?

	A = some 2x2 matrix with a clear geometric meaning (e.g., shear)

	w = xy*A;

	scatter(w(:,1), w(:,2));	transformed according to A

	cov(z)				this is computed directly from the data

	A'*cov(xy)*A			given by formula; compare against cov(z)
