Selected topics and additional practice problems for the second midterm exam

	Key sources to study from: 

	PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, their solutions on BB Vista,
	and the notes on the course homepage


1) Random variables, distribution, expected value

	example: consider the random variable V equal to the number of Aces
	among four cards drawn with replacement from a standard deck

	solution strategy A: muscle through

		first, determine the set of possible values of V; here, that 
		set is {0,1,2,3,4}; 

		next, calculate the distribution of V: for each possible value 
		n of V, calculate the probability P(V=n); notice that each of 
		the 13 face values has probability 1/13 on each draw and that
		draws are mutually independent; hence, V is just the total
		number of successes in four independent Bernoulli trials with 
		success probability 1/13, and so the probability of drawing 
		precisely n Aces is C(4,n)(1/13)^n(12/13)^(4-n)

		next, calculate the expected value of V as the weighted sum of
		the possible values of V, each weighted by its probability:

		E(V) = sum from n=0 to n=4 of n*C(4,n)*(1/13)^n*(12/13)^(4-n)

		to calculate the sum, use the hidden function trick;
		as preparation, massage the n-th term by combining powers:

			(1/13)^n*(12/13)^(4-n) = (1/12)^n * (12/13)^4

		and pull out one copy of the (1/12)^n to make what's left look 
		like a derivative (calculus):

			E(V) = (12/13)^4(1/12)sum n=0..4 n*C(4,n)*(1/12)^(n-1)

		now define a function f(x) to match the derivative in E(V):

			f(x) = sum n=0 to n=4 of C(4,n)*x^n = (1 + x)^4

		then recognize E(V) as the derivative at a suitable location:

			E(V) = (12/13)^4 (1/12) * df/dx evaluated at x = 1/12

		evaluate the derivative using the binomial expression for f(x):

			df/dx = 4(1 + x)^3

		and conclude that

			E(V) = (12/13)^4 (1/12) * 4 * (13/12)^3 = 4/13


	solution strategy B: break the problem down into easier chunks

		notice that V can be written as 

			V = V1 + V2 + V3 + V4,

		where Vi is the number of Aces on the i-th card; therefore, 

			E(V) = sum i=1..4 of E(Vi)

		all of the Vi have the same distribution, with 0, 1 as possible 
		values, P(Vi=1) = 1/13, and P(Vi=0) = 12/13; it follows that 

			E(Vi) = 1*1/13 + 0*12/13 = 1/13

		we conclude by adding up the four E(Vi) that 

			E(V) = 4/13

		isn't that easier than strategy A?


2) Variance and standard deviation; Chebyshev's inequality

	example: 

	a) calculate the standard deviation of V from the above example

	solution:

		we'll skip strategy A since we know better now

		write V = sum i=1..4 of Vi as before (strategy B above)

		since the Vi are mutually independent,

			var(V) = sum i=1..4 of var(Vi)

		for any given i,

			var(Vi) = E(Vi^2) - E(Vi)^2

		but Vi^2 and Vi are the same, since x^2=x if x=0 or 1, so:

			var(Vi) = E(Vi) - E(Vi)^2 = 1/13 - 1/13^2 = 12/13^2

		and therefore

			var(V) = 48/13^2

		the standard deviation is just the square root of the variance:

			std(V) = 4/13*sqrt(3)	(approx. 0.5)

	b) using only E(V) = 4/13, std(V) = 0.5, but not the detailed PMF of V,
	find an upper bound on the probability that V is 3 or greater

	solution:

		3 - 4/13 is about 5 standard deviations of V; by Chebyshev,

		P(V >= 3) = P(|V-4/13| > 2 + 9/13) < 1/25 = 0.04

		(actual probability is less than 0.002, five times smaller)
	

3) Jointly distributed pairs of random variables

	example: determine the joint distribution of the following RVs X and Y,
	both defined on the random experiment of rolling two fair dice; are X
	and Y independent?

	X = total points on the two dice,  Y = points on the first die

	solution:

		The possible values of X are the integers 2...12
		The possible values of Y are the integers 1...6

		For s in the range 2...12 and any n in the range 1...6,

			P(X=s and Y=n) = P(first=n and second=s-n)

			= 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 by independence of tosses

		This assumes that s-n is also between 1 and 6, so the above
		holds in the trapezoid {(s,n) | 1<=s<=12, 1<=n<=6, 1<=s-n<=6}

		For (s,n) outside the trapezoid described above,

			P(X=s and Y=n) = 0

		Notice that there are many (s,n), such as (11,3),
		for which the joint distribution P(X=s and Y=n) is zero at (s,n)
		but both P(X=s) and P(Y=n) are nonzero 

		Therefore, the joint distribution cannot be reconstructed as
		the product of the marginal distributions of X and Y

		This shows that X and Y are not independent

		By the way, the reconstruction fails even inside the trapezoid:

			P(X=s) = (6 - abs(s-7)) / 36, which is < 1/6 unless s=7

			P(Y=n) = 1/6

		Therefore, the product P(X=s)*P(Y=n) only equals 1/36 if s=7


4) Covariance and independence

	example: two random variables, X and Y, are known to be independent;
	what is the covariance of the random variables aX + bY and bX - aY?

	solution: use bilinearity of covariance:

		cov(aX+bY,bX-aY) = abcov(X,X)-a^2cov(X,Y)+b^2cov(Y,X)-bacov(Y,Y)

	by symmetry of covariance, the above becomes

		cov(aX+bY,bX-aY) = ab (var(X)-var(Y)) + (b^2 - a^2) cov(X,Y) 

	by independence of X, Y, cov(X,Y) is 0, so:

		cov(aX+bY,bX-aY) = ab (var(X)-var(Y))


5) Gaussian random variables

	example a) suppose that Z is a standard normal RV (E(Z)=0, var(Z)=1).
	use Z to define a normal RV Y with expected value 3 and standard
	deviation 5.

	solution:

		Y = 5*Z + 3

		E(Y) = 5*E(Z) + E(3) 

			= 5*0 + 3 = 3

		Since the RVs 5Z and 3 are independent,

			var(Y) = var(5*Z) + var(3)

			= 5^2 * var(Z) + 0

			= 25*1 = 25

		so that

			stdev(Y) = sqrt(var(Y)) = 5


	example b) Use built-in MATLAB functions to compute the probability
	that the RV Y described in example a above will have a value greater
	than 10.

	solution:

		You get a standard normal RV Z from Y as follows:

			Z = (Y - 3) / 5

		In terms of Z, the desired probability is:

			P(Z > (10-3)/5) = P(Z > 7/5)

		This translates to an expression in terms of the CDF F of Z:

			1 - F(7/5)

		The following computation in MATLAB therefore does the job:

			normcdf(7/5)
