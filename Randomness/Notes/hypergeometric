Another discrete probability distribution: hypergeometric

	Consider a finite collection of N objects, of which M are "special"

		for example, M=4 Aces within a deck of N=52 cards

	If objects drawn sequentially from collection with replacement, success 
	defined as drawing special object, then this is sequence of independent 	Bernoulli trials; total number of successes has binomial distribution

	However, if objects drawn without replacement, then the trials are
	not independent (why?), and we have a different situation altogether

	What is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials then?

	We consider the sample space

		S = all combinations of n objects taken from the N

		which has NCn equally probable elements

	Then:

		P(k successes) = # combinations with k successes / NCn

	A combination is considered when it contains exactly k special objects

	There are MCk ways of selecting k special objects from the M available

	Having selected the k special objects, there are (N-M)C(n-k) ways of
	selecting n-k of N-M non-special objects to complete a set of n objects

	Therefore,

		P(k successes) = MCk*(N-M)C(n-k)

	This is called a hypergeometric distribution
