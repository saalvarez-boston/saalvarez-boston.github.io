1) Random experiments as specified by a sample space of all possible outcomes
and a probability function on the sample space

	sample task format 1) for a given informal description of a random 
	experiment or a random event, specify a sample space that provides 
	a good model for the given situation; perhaps choose a sample space 
	for which all outcomes are equally likely to occur

	example: consider the random event "a two-card hand dealt from 
	a single standard deck of 52 cards in four suits contains cards 
	from two different suits"

	here are two sample spaces S that are reasonable models of the 
	associated random experiment:

	option A) Consider outcomes to be all unordered sets of two cards 
	taken from a single deck; there are "52 choose 2" such sets, 
	abbreviated 52C2, all of which are equally likely.

	option B) Consider outcomes to be all ordered sequences of two cards 
	taken from a single deck; there are 52*51 such permutations,
	abbreviated 52P2, all of which are equally likely.

	By the way, notice that sample space B is twice the size of
	sample space A, so that its outcomes are one-half as likely 
	to occur. Why would this not lead to different values for the 
	probability of the event of interest in the two models?


2) Random events as collections of outcomes in some sample space

	sample task format 2) Given the description of a sample space and
	an event of interest, specify the outcomes of the sample space that
	contribute to (i.e., belong to) the event of interest.

	example: Consider the above example. Let E be the event of interest,
	that is, E is the event that exactly two suits are represented in a
	random two-card hand drawn from a single deck. What outcomes are in 
	the set that defines this event? The answer depends on what sample 
	space is being used. We consider options A and B as described above.

	option A) If the outcomes are unordered pairs of cards, then E is the 
	set of unordered pairs of cards of different suits. How many such 
	unordered pairs are there? First, there are 4C2 = 6 ways to select two 
	suits from among the four possible suits; having selected a pair of 
	suits, there are 13 x 13 pairs of cards of those particular suits.

	option B) If the outcomes are ordered pairs of cards, then E is the 
	set of ordered pairs of cards of different suits. How many such ordered 
	pairs are there? First, there are 4C2 = 6 ways to select two suits from 
	among the four possible suits; having selected a pair of suits, there 
	are 2P2 = 2 ways to order those two suits; having selected and ordered 
	the two suits, there are 13 x 13 pairs of cards of those particular 
	suits in that particular order.

	As you can see, the event E as represented in sample space B is twice 
	the size of the event E as represented in sample space A. Therefore,
	the probability of event E is the same when computed in either of the
	two sample spaces, since the sizes of the sample spaces are in the
	same 1:2 ratio.


3) Calculation of probabilities

	sample task format 3) given an informal description of a random
	event E, first find a suitable sample space that models the associated
	random experiment (as in task format 1, above), then find the outcomes
	that correspond to the specific event E (as in task format 2, above),
	and then calculate the probability of the event E.

	example: consider the probability of getting two different suits in a
	random pair of cards drawn from a single deck. We can model the random
	experiment using either of the two sample spaces A, B described above.
	As we saw, the choice of a sample space also affects the specific
	makeup of the set that represents the event of interest: the set E
	consists of half as many outcomes in sample space A than in sample
	space B. We pick one of these two sample spaces, say A, in which
	outcomes are unordered pairs of two different cards. As discussed
	above, we know the following facts:

		the size of sample space A is 52C2 = 52 * 51 / 2 = 26 * 51

		the size of event E is 4C2 * 13 * 13 = 6 * 13 * 13

	Since all outcomes in A are equally likely, the probability of E is:

		P(E) = |E| / |A| = 6 * 13 * 13 / (26 * 51)

	If you want to distill this expression down to a numerical value,
	simplification is in order:

		P(E) = 3 * 26 * 13 / (26 * 51) = 39 / 51 = 13 / 17

	Since 17 is about 4/3 of 13, a rough estimate of this value is 0.75.
	

4) MATLAB basics

	sample task format 4) write a single MATLAB statement (or perhaps 
	a short MATLAB script) that performs a given computational task

	example: simulate a sequence of 100 trials, each consisting of 20
	tosses of a loaded coin with P(heads) = 0.7, using the rand function;
	the result should be a vector named sim of size 100 x 20.

	Here is a single MATLAB statement that achieves the desired goal:

		sim = (rand(100,20) < 0.7);

	Determine the average number of heads obtained in each 20-toss run,
	yielding a vector of size 100 x 1, with the mean of the i-th run
	in the i-th row of the result vector:

		mean(sim,2)


5) Counting, combinations and permutations, sums

	sample task format 5a) determine the number of objects that satisfy
	a stated condition

	example: how many different length-6 sequences of letters (A-Z)
	contain precisely three different letters?

	Let S denote the set of all length-6 A-Z sequences that include
	precisely three different letters. Each sequence in S is determined 
	uniquely by a choice of three different letters of the alphabet 
	(e.g., a,b,c), followed by six ordered choices among those letters, 
	with the requirement that each of the three selected letters be used 
	at least once (e.g., abcabc, cbabbb are ok, but not abbbaa). There are 
	C(26,3) = 26*25*24/6 = 2600 different combinations of three letters 
	of the alphabet. By the multiplication principle, |S| therefore equals 
	C(26,3) * |S(a,b,c)|, where S(a,b,c) is the set of all elements of S 
	that include only the specific letters a,b,c (any other choice of three 
	letters of the alphabet would serve just as well here).

	Now we need to count the elements of S(a,b,c). By the multiplication 
	principle, there are 3^6 = 729 different ordered sequences of length 6 
	over the alphabet {a,b,c}. Of these sequences, only the ones that use 
	each of the letters a,b,c at least once are in S(a,b,c).
	It is easier to count the sequences that use two or fewer of these
	three letters: 
	
		the words aaaaaa, bbbbbb, cccccc use precisely one letter.

		using a specific pair of the three letters, say a and b,
		but not the third letter (c in this case), there are 2^6
		possible (unallowed) words by the multiplication principle,
		except that you have to be careful not to count aaaaaa and
		bbbbbb again, so 2^6 - 2 = 62 possible words that use both
		of the letters of a given pair such as a, b; since there are
		C(3,2) = 3 different such pairs of letters, the total number
		of unallowed words that use precisely two of the letters a,b,c
		is C(3,2)*(2^6 - 2) = 3*62 = 186.

		combining the two ingredients above, se see that there are
		3 + 186 = 189 words among the 729 different length-6 words
		over {a,b,c} that do not use all three letters; therefore,
		the remaining 729 - 189 = 540 words use each of the letters
		a,b,c at least once. That is, |S({a,b,c})| = 540.

		We conclude that the total number of length-6 words that use
		a total of three diffreent letters is C(26,3)*540 = 2600*540.

	sample task format 5b) compute the value of a sum in closed form

	example: reduce the sum 1 + 2/2 + 3/4 + ... + n/2^(n-1) to closed form

	Use the hidden function trick. Why, do you ask? Well, the sum is very 
	much like the simpler sum 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/2^(n-1),
	except for the telltale multiplicative factors 1,2,3,...n, which I
	will interpret as coming from the derivatives of x, x^2, x^3, ... x^n.

	So, define the function 

		f(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^n, 

	where the 1 has been included because it completes the geometric sum 
	nicely, without changing the x-derivative in the slightest. 
	The derivative is:

		f'(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ... + nx^{n-1}

	Since we really want to see powers of 1/2 instead of xs, plug in x=1/2:

		f'(x) at x=1/2 equals  1 + 2/2 + 3/4 + ... + n/2^(n-1), 

	which is precisely the target sum.

	The closed form for the sum results from the fact that f(x) itself
	a geometric sum with the following closed form:

		f(x) = (x^{n+1}-1) / (x-1)

	The derivative therefore has a closed form as well:

		f'(x) = ((n+1)x^n (x-1) - (x^{n+1}-1)) / (x-1)^2

	Plug in x=1/2 now, and simplify (do it) to find:

		f'(x) at x=1/2 equals 4 - (n+2)/2^(n-1)

	There you go. 


6) Conditional probability and independence

	sample task format 6) determine if two specific events are independent

	example: a word of length 5 over the alphabet a-z is randomly selected.
	Are the following two events independent, or not?
	
		A = {the word contains the letter a exactly three times} 

	and

		B = {the word contains the letter b exactly two times} 

	Intuitively, A and B are dependent, because if, say, A is known to
	occur, then 3 of the 5 slots of the randomly selected word must be as;
	if so, only two slots remain to be filled, making it very unlikely
	that both slots will be filled with bs.

	Detailed calculation:

	compare the probabilities of B under two assumptions: first, 
	no assumption whatsoever ("prior probability"), and second,
	the assumption that A is known to occur

		P(B) = C(5,2) 25^3 / 26^5 = 10 25^3 / 26^5

		P(B | A) = P(B and A) / P(A)
			= P(exactly two bs and three as) / P(exactly three as)
			= (C(5,2)/26^5) / (C(5,3) 25^2 / 26^5)
			= C(5,2) / (C(5,3) 25^2)
			= 1 / 25^2

	How do these compare? You can certainly ask MATLAB. However, note
	that it is easy to guess which is larger:

		P(B) = 10 25^3 / 26^5 is close to 10 26^3 / 26^5, which is
		10 times P(B | A)

	Thus, the probability that B will be observed is much reduced if A 
	is known to occur, so that A has a definite conditioning effect on B

	In other words, A and B are not independent
