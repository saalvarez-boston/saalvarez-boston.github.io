Summation and the hidden function trick (week 3-4)

	Probability calculations often involve adding expressions

	We discuss some useful tools to compute summations in special cases

		Geometric sums and series

		Binomial expansion

		Hidden function trick


Geometric sums and series

	These are sums of consecutive powers of the same base, b:

		1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^k + ... + b^n

	Let S(n) denote the value of the sum for powers 0 through n
	(recall that b^0 = 1, so that's just the first term above)

	To get a formula for S(n), multiply S(n) by the base, b:

		S(n)*b = b + b^2 + b^3 + ... + b^{n+1}

	Notice that the result looks a lot like the sum for S(n),
	so there will be a lot of cancellation if we subtract the two:

		S(n)*b - S(n) = b^{n+1} - 1

	Then just solve for S(n):

		S(n) = (b^{n+1} - 1) / (b - 1)

	A geometric series is the name given to the limit as n -> infinity:

		S(infinity) = limit of S(n) as n -> infinity

	This limit will only be a well-defined numerical value if the base, b,
	is smaller than 1 in absolute value, in which case the term b^{n+1}
	approaches 0 as n approaches infinity, so that the value is:

		S(infinity) = -1/(b-1) = 1/(1-b)


Binomial expansion

	Counting shows that a power of a sum of two terms is related
	to the combinatorial coefficients C(n,k) ("n choose k")

		(a + b)^n = sum from k=0 to k=n of C(n,k) a^k b^{n-k}

	This is because (a + b)^n is the product of n copies of (a + b)

	If you imagine the n copies spread out in front of you,
	you see that a term a^k b^{n-k} will result by choosing the a term
	in exactly k of the copies, and the b term in the remaining n-k copies

	There are precisely C(n,k) ways of choosing a different combination
	of slots in that way

	The "binomial expansion" formula involving C(n,k) is useful in
	computing the values of sums

	For example, consider the sum

		1 + 10 + C(10,2) + C(10,3) + ... C(10,k) + ... + 10 + 1

	If you realize that this sum is the same as the binomial expansion
	of the expression (1 + 1)^10, then the value of the sum is clear:
	it is just 2^10 (or 1024)


Hidden function trick

	Consider a minor variation of the sum used for the binomial expansion
	example above:

		10 + 2 C(10,2) + 3 C(10,3) + ... + k C(10,k) + ... + 10

	It is not obvious how to obtain the value of this sum by using the
	binomial expansion

	However, notice that the k factors are curiously like the ones that
	you get by differentiating the monomials x^k with respect to x

	What if the target sum is the derivative of some function?

	Define the following function:

		f(x) = x^0 + C(10,1) x^1 + ... + C(10,k) x^k + ... + x^10

	Then the derivative of f(x) is reminiscent of the original sum:

		f'(x) = C(10,1) x^0 + ... + k C(10,k) x^{k-1} + ... + 10 x^9

	Except that there's a pesky x in the way

	Get rid of x by setting x=1 in the derivative expression:

		f'(x) at x=1 is precisely equal to the original sum!

	Does that help?

	Yes, because we can find a simple ("closed form") expression for f(x),
	and therefore for f'(x), by using the binomial expansion:

		f(x) = (1 + x)^10

		f'(x) = 10 (1 + x)^9

		f'(x) at x=1 equals 10 2^9, so that's the value of the sum!


A harder hidden function trick example (outline, meant for you to fill in)

	Consider finding a simple expression for the sum

		15 + 4 C(15,2) + ... + k^2 C(15,k) + ... + 15^2

	The k^2 factor doesn't look like a derivative, but it would if
	it were k(k-1) instead, since that would result from taking the
	second derivative of x^k with respect to x

	So, hoping that will bring us closer to a solution, try defining
	the following hidden function (I'm skipping some steps, which you 
	should fill in):

		f(x) = (1 + x)^15

	Then 

		f"(x) at x=1 = 2(1) C(15,2) + ... + k(k-1) C(15,k) + ... + 15(14)

	so that

		target sum = (f"(x) at x=1) + (sum of k C(15,k) for k=1..15)

	The second derivative term on the right-hand side is just

		f"(x) at x=1 = 15(14)(1 + x)^13 at x=1, which is 210 2^13

	Computing the sum of k C(15,k) for k=1..15 is a problem like the one
	solved above; that sum equals 15 2^14

	We conclude that the target sum (with the k^2 factors) equals

		210 2^13 + 15 2^14 = 15 2^17
