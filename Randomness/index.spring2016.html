You won't need to purchase a textbook. Instead, I'll provide a set of course 
notes that I'm writing for CSCI 2244, Randomness and Computation, as part of 
a collaboration with Prof. Howard Straubing, who is writing corresponding notes 
for CSCI 2243, Logic and Computation. A grant from the <a href="http://libguides.bc.edu/affordable/2015">Affordable Course Materials Initiative</a> provided
support for this effort over the summer of 2015. Students who are enrolled in
this course may access the notes on <a href="https://bc.edu/lms">Canvas</a>.

<h3>What this course is about</h3>
</a>
CSCI 2244 provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and tools that 
enable advanced work in modeling and computation involving randomness. The 
focus is on discrete probability. Topics include probability spaces, random 
variables, conditional probability, limit theorems, and Markov chains. 
Selected topics in linear algebra are discussed in connection with the 
analysis of covariance. Randomness in the sense of algorithmic succinctness 
(e.g., Kolmogorov complexity) is mentioned in passing, but is not discussed 
at length. Computational illustrations in Python are given throughout the course.

<p>

<a name="prereq">
<h3>Prerequisites / Required Background</h3>
</a>
<b>The official prerequisites for CSCI 2244 are Computer Science I (CSCI 1101)
and calculus (MATH 1102/1103 or equivalent).</b>
In particular, it is assumed that CSCI 2244 students are 
comfortable with fundamental programming techniques, as well 
as with basic concepts of differential and integral calculus. 
Writing short programs in Python will be required in some of the problem sets.
See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/</a>.

<p>

<a name="strategy">
<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</a>
This is a challenging course. Students should plan to work hard,
to keep up with the reading assignments, and to start problem sets 
early. 
<!--
are two key habits
that should be developed (if necessary) and maintained for the 
entirety of the course.
-->
Assigned reading will usually follow the in-lecture discussion
fairly closely, but there may be a few exceptions to this rule.
Therefore, it is important to make sure that you've understood 
all of the the material covered in the lectures in addition to 
that in the reading assignments. <i>I cannot overstate the
importance of conscientiously doing all of the problem sets
in order to master the course material</i>.
When preparing problem set solutions, you should strive for
maximum clarity. Your write-ups should reveal the key ingredients 
and the structure of your reasoning. Include detailed explanations.
These comments apply equally to exam solutions.
<p>
I'll be happy to discuss any questions during my regular office hours. 
If you can't make it to my office hours, please contact me by e-mail so 
that we can try to schedule an appointment at a mutually convenient time.

<p>
<h4>No networked devices policy</h4>
<i>The use of portable computers (laptops, tablets) or phones is not permitted
in class.</i> Prior experience suggests that such devices can be distracting
and detrimental to learning, both for the user and for others around him / her.
Computational experimentation with the course material outside of class is 
highly encouraged.

<p><hr><p>

<a name="grading">
<h3>Grading</h3>
</a>

The course grade will be based on problem sets, exams, and class participation.

<ul>

<p><li> Problem sets will be due on Canvas most Fridays by 5 pm starting in the 
first week of classes (but check each problem set statement for exceptions). 
Each problem set will be posted approximately one week before the due date. 
<i>Late submissions will receive no credit except in very unusual 
circumstances</i> (at the discretion of the instructor). 
On the other hand, I will drop your lowest homework grade, such as a zero from 
a missed assignment, no questions asked.  
The average score on the problem sets, together with my own assessment of your
class participation (which may include an unannounced quiz or two), will 
contribute 20% of your course grade. 
<i>You must submit at least seven problem sets that demonstrate a serious 
attempt toward completion in order to be eligible for a passing grade in the 
course.</i> 

<p><li>Two in-class midterm exams will be given. You may use your own copy of 
the course notes or your own notes during exams. <i>No sharing of materials
is allowed.</i>

See the schedule below for exam dates. No make-up 
exams will be given. The average of the midterm exam scores will contribute 
50% of your course grade.

<p><li>A written final exam (see schedule below for
date and time) will count as 30% of your course grade.

<!--
<p><li>In-class activities and participation will count as 
10% of your course grade. Occasional pop quizzes or unannounced 
discussions of the current reading assignment may be held and
would contribute to this part of your grade.
-->

</ul>

<p>

<a name="honesty">
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
</a>
You are encouraged to discuss assigned homework problems (but not exams) 
with other people but you must individually design and write your own 
solutions for all assignments. Furthermore, you should explicitly 
acknowledge any sources of ideas used that are not your own; this includes 
other people, books, web pages, etc. You should not discuss exam problems
with anyone except the instructor. 
Please also read the
<!--

-->
<a href="http://www.bc.edu/publications/ucatalog/policy.shtml#integrity">
Boston College academic integrity policy</a>.
Behavior that is not in the spirit of 
the above guidelines may be reported to the appropriate class dean for 
review by the Academic Integrity Board.
<!--will be considered to be a violation of the honor code.-->

particular situation, talk to me.
