<h3>What this course is about</h3>
</a>
This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and tools that 
enable advanced work in modeling and computation involving randomness. The 
focus is on discrete probability. Selected topics in linear algebra are also 
included. Randomness in the sense of algorithmic succintness (e.g., Kolmogorov 
complexity) is mentioned in passing, but is not discussed at length in this 
first course. MATLAB is used throughout for computational illustrations.

</ul>

<p>

<a name="prereq">
<h3>Prerequisites / Required Background</h3>
</a>
The official prerequisites for CS244 are Computer Science I
(CS101) and calculus.
In particular, it is assumed that students taking CS244 are 
comfortable with fundamental programming techniques, as well 
as with basic concepts of differential and integral calculus.
CS244 involves a considerable amount of programming in MATLAB.
Prior MATLAB knowledge is not assumed.

<p>

<a name="strategy">
<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</a>
This is a challenging course. Students should plan to work hard,
to keep up with the reading assignments, and to start problem sets 
early. 
<!--
are two key habits
that should be developed (if necessary) and maintained for the 
entirety of the course.
-->
Assigned reading will usually follow the in-lecture discussion
fairly closely, but there may be a few exceptions to this rule.
Therefore, it is important to make sure that you've understood 
all of the the material covered in the lectures in addition to 
that in the reading assignments. <i>I cannot stress too much the
importance of conscientiously doing all of the problem sets
in order to master the course material</i>.
When preparing problem set solutions, you should strive for
maximum clarity. Your write-ups should reveal the key ingredients 
and the structure of your reasoning. Include detailed explanations.
These comments apply equally to exam solutions.
<p>
I'll be happy to discuss any questions during my regular office hours. 
If you can't make it to my office hours, please contact me so that we 
can try to schedule an appointment at a mutually convenient time.

<p><hr><p>

<a name="grading">
<h3>Grading</h3>
</a>

The course grade will be based on problem sets, exams, and class participation.

<ul>

<p><li> Problem sets will be due most Fridays starting in the first week 
of classes. Late submissions will receive no credit except in very unusual 
circumstances (at the discretion of the instructor). On the other hand, I will 
drop your lowest homework grade, such as a zero from a missed assignment, no 
questions asked. Problem sets should be submitted at the beginning of class 
on the due date unless otherwise indicated in the problem set statement. Each 
problem set will be posted approximately one week before the due date. The 
average score on the problem sets, together with my own assessment of your
class participation (which may include an unannounced quiz or two), will 
contribute 20% of your course grade. 
<i>You must submit at least seven problem sets that demonstrate a serious 
attempt at completion in order to be eligible for a passing grade in the 
course.</i> 

<p><li>Two in-class midterm exams will be given. See the schedule below 
for exam dates.  All exams will be open book and open notes. No make-up 
exams will be given. The average of the midterm exam scores will contribute 
50% of your course grade.

<p><li>A written final exam (see schedule below for
date and time) will count as 30% of your course grade.

<!--
<p><li>In-class activities and participation will count as 
10% of your course grade. Occasional pop quizzes or unannounced 
discussions of the current reading assignment may be held and
would contribute to this part of your grade.
-->

</ul>

<p>

<a name="honesty">
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
</a>
You are encouraged to discuss assigned homework problems (but not exams) 
with other people but you must individually design and write your own 
solutions for all assignments. Furthermore, you should explicitly 
acknowledge any sources of ideas used that are not your own; this includes 
other people, books, web pages, etc. You should not discuss exam problems
with anyone except the instructor. 
Please also read the

<a href="http://www.bc.edu/publications/ucatalog/policy.shtml#integrity">

Behavior that is not in the spirit of 
the above guidelines may be reported to the appropriate class dean for 
review by the Academic Integrity Board.
<!--will be considered to be a violation of the honor code.-->

particular situation, talk to me.
