<h3>Neural networks</h3>

Neural networks are machine learning systems that perform 
computation across a collection of interconnected processing 
units, mimicking systems of neurons in a mammalian brain. 
The weights of the connections between processing units 
determine the overall behavior of the network. These weights 
are adaptively tuned to data through a process of "learning".
The trained networks that result after learning are capable
of accurately representing functional dependencies in data.
<p>
My recent work in neural networks has involved the development
of network architectures that allow faster learning without a 
loss of predictive performance. I have also done work on visualization 
of neural networks, and on metrics that allow quantifying the 
degree of organization and symmetry in neuronal systems.
