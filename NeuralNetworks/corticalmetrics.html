<h3>Abstract</h3>

Cerebral lateralization refers to the poorly understood fact that
some functions are better controlled by one side of the brain than
the other (e.g. handedness, language). Of particular concern
here are the asymmetries apparent in cortical topographic maps
that can be demonstrated electrophysiologically in mirror-image
locations of the cerebral cortex. In spite of great interest
in issues surrounding cerebral lateralization, methods for measuring
the degree of organization and asymmetry in cortical maps are currently 
quite limited. In this paper, several measures are developed
and used to assess the degree of organization, lateralization,
and mirror symmetry in topographic map formation.
These measures correct for large constant displacements as well as 
curving of maps. The behavior of the measures is tested on
several topographic maps obtained by self-organization of
an initially random artificial neural network model of a
bihemispheric brain, and the results are compared with
subjective assessments made by humans.
