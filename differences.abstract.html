<h3>Abstract</h3>

The problem of assigning a meaningful and useful value to the
difference between two numerical measurements is an important
one that arises in a variety of contexts. Examples include 
the study of directional asymmetry in zoology and high-energy
physics, the measurement of lateralization in neurological studies
of handedness, language, and vision, and the combination of
degrees of belief and disbelief in uncertain reasoning and
knowledge-based systems. 
In the present paper we address the above problem in a 
systematic way. We list the desired properties of any
admissible <i>subjective difference measure</i>. 
Then we define a family of measures via conjugacy relative to 
a <i>blow-up transformation</i> <font face="symbol">b</font>
and describe the <i>blown-up metric</i> associated with
a given choice for <font face="symbol">b</font>.
We find necessary and sufficient conditions on
<font face="symbol">b</font> so that the associated
difference measure is admissible, and describe several 
possible choices for <font face="symbol">b</font>.
We show how to find a blow-up transformation
<font face="symbol">b</font> leading to a given measure
if one exists, thus in particular establishing the
equivalence of the basic objects of our theory:
the difference measure, the blow-up transformation,
and the metric.
We close by illustrating the application of one of our
measures to lateralization assessment in a computational
simulation of sensory map formation in a bihemispheric
brain.
