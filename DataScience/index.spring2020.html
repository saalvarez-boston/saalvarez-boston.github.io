<h4>Software</h4>

Programming in Python will be required. 
Students will need access to the software platforms below
starting in the first week of classes.
I recommend competing the "Python basics" activity in the Schedule section, 
below, as soon as possible. Students who did not previously program 
in Python for their CS1 course may wish to start by working through the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">Python tutorial</a>
available at <font size=+1 face=tty>https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</font>.

<h3>What this course is about</h3>
</a>
This course provides an introduction to concepts and techniques of computational data modeling and inference that can inform rational decision-making based on data. Topics include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and visualization, elements of probability and statistical inference, and predictive and descriptive modeling, with an introduction to machine learning concepts and approaches as time allows. Programming in Python will be required. Prospective students should also be comfortable with mathematical notation and reasoning at the college calculus level.


<a name="prereq">
<h3>Necessary Background</h3>
</a>
CSCI 2291 has as prerequisites the course CSCI 1101 (Computer Science I) or an equivalent introduction to Computer Science and programming, and one of MATH 1101, 1103, 1005, or an equivalent course in college-level calculus.
In particular, it is assumed that students will be familiar 
with the basics of the following topics before starting CSCI 2291: 
<ul>
<p><li> General mathematical notation and reasoning at the level of college 
calculus, including summation notation, algebraic reasoning, functions, and 
differential and integral calculus with functions of one variable. 
<p><li> Computational problem-solving, program design in Python,
including procedural abstraction / decomposition, functions, 
conditional branching, iteration, list comprehension, and recursion.
<!--
Writing programs in Python and reading algorithmic pseudocode will be 
required in this course. Refer to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/">Python downloads and documentation</a> at python.org. 
Please use Python 2.7 to minimize incompatibility issues.
<p><li> Object orientation, instantiable classes, data structures (e.g., mutability, lists, queues, stacks, big O).
-->
</ul>
<p>
Note: Python is a comparatively easy language to learn. A student who has taken an introduction to Computer Science using a language other than Python should be able to learn the required Python skills with a modest amount of additional study.
<p>
<!--
Additionally, some familiarity with <a href="Notes/cs243.recursionAndInduction.pdf">mathematical induction</a> would be helpful.

<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</a>

<h4>Take charge</h4>

As a 2000-level course, CSCI 2291 requires greater autonomy from students 
than do typical 1000-level courses. 
Some of the material in the course is intellectually challenging.
Lectures will cover most of the main ideas, but you will need to fill in 
the gaps by studying the references and other materials linked from the course homepage, as well as the software documentation.

Complete the reading assignments conscientiously.
A first reading is advisable <i>before</i> class. 

<h4>Tune out the noise</h4>

Engage fully with the material, in class and out. I'll help with this by
not allowing the use of laptops or phones during class. Laptop use may be
allowed for certain quizzes (and in emergencies). 
I strongly encourage you to adopt a similar policy when you are studying and
outlining program designs, except for the actual implementation phase.

<h4>Start early</h4>

Get started on each homework assignment as soon as possible. 
Plan to go over your own notes and over the relevant course materials 
several times in connection with a specific concept or problem. 
This process may take several hours or even days, depending on the 
complexity of the issue at hand.

<h4>Explain your thinking</h4>

Strive for maximum clarity and simplicity when preparing homework and quiz 
solutions. I'm looking for lucid, step-by-step explanations and discussion, 
not just the final answers. Aim for clarity over length.

<p>

<a name="grading">
<h3>Grading</h3>
</a>

The course grade will be based on quizzes and active course involvement, 
homework, and a final exam.
<ul>

<p><li> <h4>Quizzes and course involvement (35%)</h4>
<i>Class attendance and active participation are required.</i>
A substantial degree of independent work outside of class is expected.
Class discussions may involve material from the reading assignments
(see the Schedule section on this page).
I may sometimes ask individual students to explain a concept or technique
from the assigned reading to the rest of the class.
Several quizzes will be given during the term.
The quizzes may cover material from class, from the posted reading materials,
or from the homework assignments. 
<p> <i>Quizzes may require the use of a laptop, so bring yours to class, 
minding the above policy restricting their in-class use at other times.</i>
<!--
You may bring a single-sided 8"x11" / A4 sheet of notes with you
to exams. Calculators are not allowed.
<i>No make-up exams will
be given, so plan ahead.</i> 
-->

<p><li> <h4>Homework (35%)</h4>
Homework assignments will be posted on Canvas during the semester.
Due dates will be posted in the schedule section of the CSCI 2291 homepage.
<i>Late homework submissions will receive no credit</i>, except, possibly, 
in very unusual circumstances, at the discretion of the instructor.
As students in my previous courses can confirm, I mean this, so
please plan ahead.
On the other hand, I will drop each student's lowest homework score 
automatically, no questions asked ("one free strike").

<p><li> <h4> Final Exam (30%)</h4>
A written, cumulative, final exam will be held at the end of the semester, 
following the university's posted exam schedule. 
<!--

<a name="honesty">
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
</a>
<i>You must individually design and write your own solutions for
all assignments unless otherwise stated.</i> Furthermore, you should
explicitly acknowledge any sources of ideas that are not your own.
This includes other people, books, web pages, etc.
Behavior that is not in the spirit of these guidelines is considered
to be academically dishonest and may be reported to the appropriate
class dean for review by the Academic Integrity Board.
If you're unsure about what constitutes academic dishonesty
in a particular situation, ask me before proceeding further.
<p>
You may also consult the
<a href="http://www.bc.edu/integrity">
university's academic integrity policies</a>.
