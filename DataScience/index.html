<h3>What this course is about</h3>
</a>
This course provides an introduction to concepts and techniques of 
computational data modeling and inference that can inform rational 
and responsible decision-making based on data. Topics include data 
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and visualization, 
predictive and descriptive modeling based on statistical and machine 
learning concepts and approaches, and matters related to bias,
confidentiality, and privacy. Programming in Python will be required. 
Prospective students should be comfortable with mathematical notation 
and reasoning at the college calculus level, as well as basic concepts
of mathematical probability.


<a name="prereq">
<h3>Necessary Background</h3>
</a>
As of the 2023-2024 academic year, CSCI 2291 is a core course in the
<a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/undergraduate/mcas/interdisciplinary-programs-minors.html">MCAS Data Science Minor</a>.
The official prerequisites are CSCI 1090 Data Science Principles and
MATH 2250 Mathematical Foundations of Data Science. 
In particular, it is assumed that students will be familiar 
with the basics of the following topics before starting CSCI 2291: 
<ul>
<p><li> Computational problem-solving, program design in Python,
including procedural abstraction / decomposition, functions, 
conditional branching, iteration, list comprehension, and recursion.
<p><li> General mathematical notation and reasoning at the level of college 
calculus, including summation notation, algebraic reasoning, functions, and 
differential and integral calculus with functions of one or more variables. 
<p><li> Basics of matrices and matrix arithmetic.
<p><li> Concepts of probability, including sample spaces, probability 
distributions, random variables, independence and conditional probability,
and jointly distributed random variables.
</ul>
<p>
Alternatively, the needed programming background for this course can be 
acquired through CSCI 1101 (Computer Science I) or an equivalent introduction 
to Computer Science and programming. 
The minimum alternative mathematical background includes MATH 1101, 1103, 1005, 
or an equivalent course in college-level calculus, and probability at the level 
of CSCI 2244 Randomness & Computation or MATH 4410 Probability.
<p>
<b><i>Please note, however, that for purposes of the Data Science Minor, 
any substitutions for CSCI 1090 and MATH 2250 would need to be approved by 
the Data Science Program Director.</i></b>
</p>

<!--
Writing programs in Python and reading algorithmic pseudocode will be 
required in this course. Refer to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/">Python downloads and documentation</a> at python.org. 
Please use Python 2.7 to minimize incompatibility issues.
<p><li> Object orientation, instantiable classes, data structures (e.g., mutability, lists, queues, stacks, big O).
-->
<!--
<p>
Note: Python is a comparatively easy language to learn. A student who has taken an introduction to Computer Science using a language other than Python should be able to acquire the required Python skills with a modest amount of additional study.
<p>
-->
<!--
Additionally, some familiarity with <a href="Notes/cs243.recursionAndInduction.pdf">mathematical induction</a> would be helpful.

<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</a>

<h4>Take charge</h4>

As a 2000-level course, CSCI 2291 requires greater autonomy from students 
than do typical 1000-level courses. 
Some of the material in the course is intellectually challenging.
Lectures will cover most of the main ideas, but you will need to fill in 
the gaps by studying the references and other materials linked from the course homepage, as well as the software documentation.

Complete the reading assignments conscientiously.
A first reading is advisable <i>before</i> class. 

<h4>Tune out the noise</h4>

Engage fully with the material, in class and out. I'll help with this by
not allowing the use of laptops or phones during class, except that laptops
will be needed for quizzes. Phones may be used in emergencies, of course. 
I strongly encourage you to adopt a similar policy when you are studying and
when designing programs (except for the actual implementation phase).

<h4>Start early</h4>

Get started on each homework assignment as soon as possible. 
Plan to go over your own notes and over the relevant course materials 
several times in connection with a specific concept or problem. 
This process may take several hours or even days, depending on the 
complexity of the issue at hand.

<h4>Explain your thinking</h4>

Strive for maximum clarity and simplicity when preparing homework and quiz 
solutions. I'm looking for lucid, step-by-step explanations and discussion, 
not just the final answers. Aim for clarity over length.

<p>
<!--

<a name="grading">
<h3>Grading</h3>
</a>

The course grade will be based on homework, quizzes and active 
course involvement, and a final exam. 

<h4><b>Late homework submissions will receive no credit</b></h4> 
(except, possibly, in very unusual circumstances, at the discretion of 
the instructor).
As students in my previous courses can confirm, I mean this, so
please plan ahead.

On the other hand, 
<h4><b>"One free strike" policy</b></h4>
I will drop each student's lowest homework score and lowest quiz score
automatically, no questions asked. I highly recommend that you 
not elect to miss a homework or quiz unless the circumstances merit it,
as you may need the break unexpectedly later in the semester.

<ul>

<p><li> <h4>Homework (20%)</h4>
Homework assignments will be posted on Canvas during the semester.
Due dates will be posted in the schedule section of the CSCI 2291 homepage.
Each student's lowest homework grade will be dropped.

<!--
<p><li> <h4>Midterm exam (25%)</h4>

You may bring a single-sided 8"x11" / A4 sheet of notes with you
to exams. Calculators, phones, and any networked devices are not allowed.
<i>No make-up exams will
be given, so plan ahead.</i> 

-->

<p><li> <h4>Quizzes and course involvement (50%)</h4>
Several quizzes will be given during the term. Students should bring a laptop
computer to class on which they can access Canvas.
The quizzes may cover material from class, from the posted reading materials,
or from the homework assignments. 
<!--
<p> <i>Quizzes will require the use of a laptop, so bring yours to class
if you will be in attendance on a given day, 
minding the above policy restricting the in-class use of laptops at other times.</i>
-->
My "one free strike" policy applies to both homework and quizzes:
makeup quizzes will not be offered, but I will drop each student's 
lowest quiz score automatically, no questions asked. 

<p>

Active involvement in course-related activities is required.
A substantial degree of independent work outside of class is expected,
including completing the assigned reading before class
(see the Schedule section on this page). Course involvement
may play a role in determining final grades in cases in which
the total score is on the border between letter categories.
<!--
Class discussions may involve material from the reading assignments
(see the Schedule section on this page).
I may sometimes ask individual students to explain a concept or technique
from the assigned reading to the rest of the class.
-->

<p><li> <h4>Group term project (30%)</h4>

Groups of students will collaborate on a substantial project that
illustrates key data science themes, developing some aspects further
than in class. Projects can focus on a particular application, a
set of techniques, or a data science issue ranging from technical
processing steps to societal impact. The project will require focused 
work over much of the semester. Deliverables will include a 
presentation and a written report.

<!--
<p><li> <h4> Exam (30%)</h4>
A cumulative exam will be held during the last class meeting,
as indicated in the schedule below.
You may bring a single-sided 8"x11" / A4 sheet of notes with you
to exams. Calculators are not allowed.
<i>No make-up exams will
be given, so plan ahead.</i> 
-->

<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
</a>
<i>You must individually design and write your own solutions for
all assignments unless otherwise stated.</i> Furthermore, you should
explicitly acknowledge any sources of ideas that are not your own.
This includes other people, books, web pages, etc.
Behavior that is not in the spirit of these guidelines is considered
to be academically dishonest and may be reported to the appropriate
class dean for review by the Academic Integrity Board.
If you're unsure about what constitutes academic dishonesty
in a particular situation, ask me before proceeding further.
<p>
You may also consult the
